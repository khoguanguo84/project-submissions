I realize that some of this behavior is a personality trait (I tend to be very agreeable and socially aware), but it's also a style of improv that tends to show up in most of the characters that I play.

improv,"Hello friends! 

    I'm a Chicago-based improviser who went to a more traditional local school before moving. There, we went over a bit of everything, kind of a cursory look at things like Game and The Harold. 5 levels over the course of 8 weeks each. I'm now a week out from AP5 at The Annoyance. 

I had my AP4 showcase tonight, and while I think I did well while I was on stage and had fun, I'm feeling a lil miffed. I struggle to initiate and mostly do walk-ons and tagouts. I think it's mostly just a confidence issue. I do big, grand characters, and I sometimes think they're difficult to integrate into a scene where everyone else is playing close to self in an absurd situation. 

Is this just a confidence issue? A question of reps? Why don't I allow myself to initiate more often? Why is it that I feel most comfortable playing fantasy creatures, or tropey detectives? Any direction or advice would be helpful. Like I said, I really like my walk-ons and everyone else has said they feel safe in scenes with me. I just don't know if I'm overlooking something.

**POLITICAL SATIRE WRITING CONTEST** 

Cash Prize Winners may be Offered Jobs on Editorial Team

**Organizer**

The Improve the News Foundation (ITN) is a non-profit news media technology organization led by MIT professor Max Tegmark. Its mission is to empower people to rise above controversies and understand the world in a nuanced way.

**Cash Prizes**

The following cash prizes will be awarded to top performers in the writing competition detailed in this post:

&amp;#x200B;

* First place prize - US$1,000
* Second place prize - US$500
* Third place prize - US$250
* Honorable mention - US$100

**Jobs**

ITN reserves the right to decide on offering the role of Assistant Editor to prize winners, and possibly to runner-up candidates as well, based on their performance in the writing contest and on an evaluation of their editorial competencies. About the role:

&amp;#x200B;

* The starting pay rate for an Assistant Editor is $30/hour
* The role is fully remote, from anywhere, and allows for flexible hours (full-time or part-time)
* The role allows for excellent opportunities for career growth, based on merit
* The contract type is an independent contractor
* Responsibilities include:
* Conducting general journalistic research
* Writing content
* Providing general editorial support

**Writing Contest**

ITN is organizing a contest to help the Foundation document and publicize unwelcome attempts at curtailing democracy, civil liberties, and scientific debate. The contest will also be used by ITN to identify outstanding editorial talent. The contest is open to internal candidates (from any area of ITN) and external candidates.

For this contest, all candidates will need to write three distinct texts that flag attempts at curtailing democracy, civil liberties and/or scientific debate. These may include attempts at censorship, invasion of privacy, authoritarianism and/or disregard for facts, etc. Each flag should be about 1–2 paragraphs (750 - 1500 characters) long and target these initiatives within the context of democratic countries during the past five years. The first flag should be a critique of a product, corporation or government; the second a critique of left-wing political establishment; and the third a critique of right-wing political establishment.

Candidates will receive higher evaluations if their flags:

&amp;#x200B;

* Highlight clear attempts at curtailing democracy, civil liberties and/or scientific debate, making use of reliable evidence (e.g. links to supporting facts)
* Make effective use of political satire
* Are considered very humorous to a broad audience
* Clearly state and adequately reference reliable facts
* Are written with high ethical standards
* Are concise

Candidates should write as a leader or representative of the powerful institution that they are satirizing. Optionally, candidates can also make use of complementary explainer boxes or fact boxes to clarify the facts if they think this will help improve their submission. Candidates will also be required to briefly explain why each of their flags meets a high ethical standard, i.e. why the flag is beneficial for democracy, civil liberties and/or scientific debate; AND although it may offend a particular institution, product or public figure, it does not cause harm to society as a whole.

All submissions will be evaluated blindly by a panel. To participate in this contest, the candidate will need to agree to allow ITN to edit and publish their submission in full or in part, even if they are not selected as prize winners. Such published submissions will receive, at a minimum, a $100 honorable mention.

**Evaluation for Possible Job Offer**

Prize winners and other high-performing candidates of the Writing Contest will have their resumes analyzed and may be invited to one or more interviews to help ITN decide if they should be offered the role of Assistant Editor. Candidates will receive higher evaluations if they can demonstrate, through their resume and interview(s), an elevated capacity or potential for:

&amp;#x200B;

* Taking initiative
* Being productive
* Producing high-quality work
* Communicating well in written and spoken English in an all-remote setting
* Working in teams, supporting leaders, and leading others

**Make your Submission**

&amp;#x200B;

* An open info session will be held on **Thursday, March 2, 2023, at 15:00 ET | 14:00 CT | 13:00 MT | 12:00 PT**. To participate, please email [anna@improvethenews.org](mailto:anna@improvethenews.org)

**FAQ**

**How will I know that my submission was received?**

As long as you see a confirmation upon submitting the Google form, you can be confident that we have received your submission and will review it in due course. If you have not heard back within the 30-60 day window, please reach out to [anna@improvethenews.org](mailto:anna@improvethenews.org).

**Do I need to have a certain background or degree to apply?**

We welcome submissions from people with all backgrounds — you do not necessarily need prior training in journalism. A Bachelor’s degree of some sort — or working towards one — is preferred for hiring, however. Strong knowledge of history and current events is a major bonus.

**What is the “additional explainer or fact box” in the form for?**

This is optional. If you think your flag could be improved or clarified by highlighting only the facts of the authoritarian event that you’re flagging, or if there are elements of your flag that you feel need further explaining, this can be done there. Moving dry facts to a neutral box may facilitate making your flag funny.

**Do I need to be based in the US to apply?**

No. Although ITN is a US-based company, we accept submissions for contests and work with talent all around the globe.

**How will I know if I won?**

You will be contacted by email within the 30-60 day window.

**Do I have to be interested in the job to enter the competition?**

Since we are looking to leverage this competition to hire more editorial team members, we would strongly encourage you to only apply if you would be interested in accepting a job offer as an Assistant Editor, if one is made to you, on either a part-time or full-time basis (whichever you prefer).

**Is the review process anonymous?**

Yes. Although we collect names and emails, so we know whom to contact later, all submissions are anonymized before being reviewed.

**Can I submit more than one entry?**

No. Please only enter the competition once. If there is more than one submission by the same person, we will only review the first entry, unless we have explicitly granted a resubmission beforehand (see Q9).

**I forgot to add something to my submission or would like to alter it. What should I do?**

As long as the submission deadline has not passed, we may allow resubmissions for exceptional cases. These will be granted at our own discretion.

improv,"I was watching a video about the war in Ukraine and a former soldier had an interesting take on war fighting in general. Don't present your enemy with a problem, present them with a dilemma. 

We tend to use these words interchangeably but there is a difference. A problem is a single issue that has a least painful solutions. A dilemma is a complex situation with solutions that are equally undesirable, or one in which the solution to one aspect of the dilemma inflames a different aspect of the dilemma.

In movies a car chase is a problem, the solution is to drive faster. A dilemma is more of a love triangle or robbery gone bad. Dilemmas involve egos and wants in conflict with the reality of the moment: you and your bosses wife fall in love, and your boss, fearing his wife is having an affair, confides in you as the only person they can trust. Problems are more visceral: someone is shooting at you, run and/or hide.

We've all seen improv scenes with conflict that work and conflict scenes that fall flat. I'm starting to think that maybe this problem/dilemma dynamic is at the heart of it. Problem scenes are less compelling than dilemma scenes. ""I want pizza but my roommate wants burritos"" is a problem. Until we learn about their motivations, their history, and the nature of their relationship it will stay a problem. Once we introduce motivations and egos and get a handle on the context a dilemma may emerge. 

...I think.... still chewing on it. Get off my back! But I think this is why ""customer service nightmare"" scenes work so well despite being so aggresively contrary to our generally accepted improv best practices.

improv,"Hey r/improv,

I have an idea for team rehearsals: an optional draw-from-a-hat with technique suggestions so that someone can have 1 simple technical element to focus on during a rehearsal. It'd be an optional thing where you could draw a note from a hat that might say something like ""face the audience,"" so that during the rehearsal you can fine-tune just one element of play regardless of the game/scene suggestion. I imagine they would be pretty general techniques, and should be simple enough not to distract from a scene/game's major goals.

What kind of suggestions might you all have for simple techniques? I'm thinking along the lines of:

**Stage Techniques**

* face the audience (face and body)
* notice when you're standing in front of a partner and cheat-out so the audience can clearly see you and your partner
* play to both left and right sides of the audience
* project your voice to the back of the room
* practice a stage whisper in a scene

**Scene Techniques**

* name your partner
* initiate a scene as if you already know your partner
* practice justifying an entrance and an exit
* practice naming details

**Physicality Techniques**

* level differently from your partner (if they're standing, sit or lie)
* start a scene performing an action
* play at a lower/higher level of tension than usual

**Character Techniques**

* play a high status character
* play a low status character
* justify a change in status
* enter a scene as a pair

Hopefully, the caveat would be that none of the prompts should conflict with the actual game/scene goals once rehearsal starts, but I think it could be a fun way to help players work on random techniques individually, and give them inspiration if they feel stuck and need one thing to focus on.

Any ideas for simple, focused, but general technical directions?",Improv/Stage Technique suggestions

improv,"  

I had a lot of nice comments about an exercise I posted the other day and I thought I would share a variant on a classic improv warm-up I have been doing for a while now.   
 

So you might all know of the warm-up “What Are You Doing?” It’s a disassociation/object work game that is played a couple of ways but here is the standard way I was taught.   
 

Have your group circle up. One person will start by miming some kind of action. Like riding a bike. Person on their left asks, “Hey So-and-So, what are you doing?”, and they will respond by naming an action that is ANYTHING OTHER than what they are currently doing. So, they might say, “I’m climbing a ladder.” Now the person who asked that, starts miming that action, person who was riding the bike stops, and the person to the left of the new person repeats this all the way around the circle.

The simple tweak I like to add is just following up their response to “what are you doing?” with “and why are you doing that?” This allows us to not only give the person some object work to do, but also an emotion/history to play it with.   
 

“What are you doing?”  
 

“Climbing a ladder.”  
 

“WHY are you doing that?”  
 

“I just need to get away/ I’m running from the cops/ I’m bored.”  
 

This to me is so important because if I said to a student, “hey, start this scene by getting a beer out of a fridge”, that’s okay. But if I said “get the beer out of the fridge like you just got done working a 12 hour shift at a blue collar job”, or, “get the beer out of the fridge like you’re at a frat party”, those are two very different ways of portraying the exact same task. The way in which we do actions on stage are not just what we’re doing but how we carry ourselves doing it. We’ve evolved for so long to pick up on social ques, and faces, and I think students often think just doing any action is enough. To quote Meisner, “an ounce of behavior is worth a pound of words.”   
 

All that to say, I really have found a lot of success teaching this, and I will often run it the normal way once through, and then add on the “and why are you doing that?” to show them how much knowing a characters motivations or circumstances can change the way we do object work and physicality.

Once  upon a time, on a whim, I hired a caricaturist to do a picture of my troupe. I thought it would be fun for a show poster.

That silly picture, and  the communal joy it brought, suddenly made us a group where everybody  belonged.

I thought that effect was a fluke, and I did it again two years later (mostly new troupe due to turnover)  and the same thing happened!  So now it is something I do periodically.

I find myself in two scenarios with ""and-ing"" my partners lately:

(1)     I often find myself knowing the ""type of thing to say"" (eg. oh, my partner said X, I should try to say something analogous that's a bit heightened) , but not being able to bring to mind and articulate **any specific thing that fits the bill** in the moment. Like, my specific-detail-mental-library isn't full enough to pull up something reasonably related to what my partner said, and even when I CAN think of something I often can't articulate the appropriate name (eg. I might say ""guy who drips water on their foreheads""  instead of me saying ""water torturer"", leaving my partner to guess what I mean).

(2)    And then when I think ""eh, eff it, I'll try to listen and react and not think too much"", then I'll tend to say something COMPLETELY off the wall that doesn't help the scene and is just random!

Does anyone have any tips for improving this stuff while by myself? I'm thinking I need to improve my miscellaneous cultural reference knowledge, verbal recall &amp; articulation, and ability to connect miscellaneous things in a reasonable way that build on each other.

improv,"  

I think a good justification can really make improv scenes so much easier to tag out to fun ideas, and to heighten from within, and I wanted an exercise that works on the unusual character arguing why they are right but in a not so argumentative way, and so I came up with the following exercise.  
 

Real Estate Agent:  
 

We get 3 people up. 1 of them is going to be a real estate agent showing a property. The other 2 are potential buyers of the space.   
 

Each scene will start with the characters introducing themselves to each other at the property, and setting where we are/who we are. “So nice to meet you. We’ve really been looking for a good restaurant space and hope this will be it.”, or something along those lines. And then we start a tour of the space.

The potential buyers, your job is to point out unusual things/flaws in every room of the tour. “I couldn’t help but notice that there is an obstacle course you have to go through to get to the closet”, or, “it looks like that door leads to a portal to hell, am I correct?”   
 

The real estate agent, your job is to sell them on why those things are actually positive. The way a real estate agent will spin a tiny kitchen into being a “cozy kitchen.” So the portal to hell example might be replied to with a, “yes it is, which I don’t know about you and your family, but it’s a great way for me to see a lot of relatives I never thought I would see again.”, or you might spin the obstacle course into, “we don’t like to call them obstacle courses, we like to call them opportunity courses.”   
 

For the potential buyers, you’re also there to push back if the real estate agent’s answers are flawed, but in the way you would with someone who you have a cordial relationship with. “I would like to see my aunt Barb again, I’m just worried maybe the kids will accidently find their way into this portal to hell.” And from there you just have this back and forth for a second before resting it and moving on to a different room of the house.   
 

I like this exercise because it teaches unusual characters to not back down on what they believe, as well as works on the voice of reasons to push back but not in ways that are automatically a fight. It also works on resting the game, and just going back to the base reality of the scene. If you have this back and forth about something in the kitchen, and you feel like it’s gone on long enough, just continue your tour of the house and discover a new unusual thing.

It’s unfortunate but this tends to happen to me so much! I start a hobby, there is no pressure to it because I’m just a newby trying to have fun and once something is at stake I freeze, get in my head and it stunts my performance.

improv,"Hi there,

I run improv jams in an area where most people speak English as a second language. One participant has a fairly broken level and has also privately admitted to me that they are ""slow"" and have some kind of ADD type problem and therefore have a hard time internalizing a ruleset on the first go. This person never follows any of the limitations/instructions that we have set up for scenes/games and as a result disrupts the creative process/output/flow of what's happening. Other actors/participants get ""stuck"" as a result when playing along and not in a good/productive way.

e.g. in a game where everyone has to speak using the next letter of the alphabet, this person will consistently mess up and speak using a random letter and about a complete non-sequitur not related to the story (therefore not only breaking the flow of the story but also breaking the only integral rule of the game which is to use the next letter of the alphabet).

This makes doing scenes together, quite frankly, kind of frustrating at times. This particular person also never ""gets"" any of the games that we do and always breaks the flow of what's happening.

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this? I'm at a bit of a loss since most games that we practice require a decent level of English comprehension/output, and it's almost unfair to the other actors when its their turn to share the stage with this person.

This person, although problematic in the aforementioned ways, shows a lot of enthusiasm and shows up on a regular basis and is open to participating. I'm not sure what to do.","how to run a session with a ""slow""///poor English speaker?"

improv,"Hi all! Posting here for the first time.

First a bit of context:

I'm part of a local amateur improv group. We have been doing improv for about a few years now. The group is a mix of experience levels. Some core group members have been doing it for years together and we accept new people with different levels. We do it for being a bit creative in life and perhaps don't do enough learning of new things. Once in a while, one of us would attend a workshop. But that does not mean that we don't try to improve. We do analyze and read about techniques and apply them.

One thing that has been bothering me a bit lately is how our group deals with suggestions for the scenes and games. I feel like we jump to the suggestion too soon.

Let's say it's a scene game, and the suggestion is ""Pasta"". Actors would start the scene and most probably it will be an Italian restaurant or a supermarket, or a spouse cooking at home. And even the word pasta would be uttered within the first 5 lines.

This is well and fine, but I feel like we are bound by the suggestion too much. Why can't a scene with this same suggestion can be at a funeral and maybe pasta is just used as a final punch line? Or is something minor in the background?

We talked about this in our group, but it seems to be something difficult to incorporate.

My question is, what kind of exercises we can do to practice this better and learn to be more mindful about it?",How to work better with suggestions?

A couple specific things I worry about:

1) Not knowing the scene like I used to... Covid, I'm sure, did a number on the improv scene. I grew up a Second City loyalist, but I think the discourse around them has changed a lot in recent years. I would love specific advice for where to train, with an emphasis on getting on stage, and networking with others who are as or more serious about pursuing improv. 

2) Getting on stage. I want to perform. Desperately want to be one of those people I saw up on stage as a teenager. I've missed it since covid. I'm sure you all know that high, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't chasing that dragon. If I move and pursue this, the goal I set will be to have some form of regular performance engagement within six months. Is that realistic? 

Maybe I sound too eager, or a little manic. Maybe I am, but I feel like I'm at a real turning point here, where if this is what I want I need to dive in soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been doing improv for a while and one of the things that I feel is holding me back is my core acting skills. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where as other performers can embody big characters with different voices with varying energy levels and moving around the stage alot , I have quite a flat affect and a limited amount of accents/voices I can do and am often prone to being a ’talking head’ in one spot.

of course i will be polite and not indicate who's class this might be, but i had to find out the hard way that you get what you pay for.

it was free.

it was HORRIBLE!

the teacher said it was for first timers, but clearly it was not.

They  didnt even speak to us, or get our names, they just threw us into the exercises without explaining the game, let alone anything else.  the people in the class were bitchy and competitive. I asked questions, but after a while i just got tired. it was exhausting, trying to figure out what to do, and what they teacher was even talking about. 

i told myself, improv is about taking the pressure off, not putting it on. so, calm down, have fun, dont over think it. it will be ok.

it was so not. my biggest fear is being put on the spot. i dont know what to say, the cat gets my tongue and all that. you know how it is. And i went to the class because i know i still have something to offer. im embarrassed to say it, but i trusted that teacher. all he did was put us on the spot and expect us to know what to do. it was confusing, and frustrating, and soul crushing all at the same time. talk about pressure!

However, pandemic attrition has taken its toll and we're actively auditioning for new blood.

Started improv in the fall and am now in next level class. Am neurodivergent, good at book-learning, have elevated risk of COVID complications and am taking class just to laugh after being cooped up for 2+ years. Besides wanting to laugh “in community” I strive to be a good partner/side/wing person. I AM having fun and want to continue (I need fun) but also balance risk. 

I can set up my scene partner to get a laugh. I don’t care about performing for an audience. And that was before I got pretty sick from being unmasked for the finale show and learned the stage lights really bother me. 

Teachers insist attending shows is the way to learn. I have trouble remembering all the rules (learning style requires reading, then doing). I have watched a few improv video shows and it’s not that helpful and very male dominated. Any suggestions for guide books or something to study between classes, especially ones that feature women?

improv,"I only started improv about a year ago and am about to graduate from from the final class at my local comedy club. The group I am taking classes with at the moment is looking to start a troupe with all the people who are currently in the class. I have so much fun doing this and would love to continue. 

I do have a problem I've been noticing. It seems that my performances are quite inconsistent. Out of the last four shows I've been in two of my shows went amazing and better than I could have imagined. However, the other two shows have been not so great.  This bothers me mostly because I've noticed that the other performers have been more consistent than me.

I've been trying to come up with reasons as to why two of the shows were far better than the others. It seems that it may be because the shows that I did well, I started things and took an initiative right away. The two shows that I did worse on I didn't take initiative right away. This can be difficult due to the formatting and trying to give others opportunity. I will not always have the opportunity to start things in the show and this is something that I will have to work on. The group I'm in is full of seasoned performers with a theatre background or people that have careers geared towards entertainment. I'm currently an engineer, and I have no background in theatre. I think this could also play in. When I'm sitting on the side at the beginning it becomes really intimidating to see everyone up there consistently making the audience laugh, and I think that puts a lot of pressure on me. My main problem with the last show was not getting in enough. I kept thinking I have to come up with the most interesting thing or have the perfect line and if it's not good enough, I won't get out there.  The order has been GOOD BAD GOOD BAD. I think it's also possible that after a good show I put too much pressure on myself for the next show. I feel like I need to somehow get in the mindset of just going out and having fun with my friends and being goofy and not relying too much on the audience's opinion of me. I just don't know how to get there.

I talked to my team about this, and they said if I have an idea just get out there and they will be there to support me. If any mistakes are made we can talk about it later or practice on it. They said during the show I should just trust my instinct. 

I'm also really hard on myself most of the time in general. I think in life this has paid off for the most part. This can still be worked on. However, in improv I think this mostly hurts me.",Any advice for having more consistent performances?

A troupe I'm in does a cold open with Town Hall. Troupe members pick someone in the audience and sit next to them. We chat them up to get their name, where they're from, and any other particulars we can. Then when we're called on by the mayor, we say something like, ""I'm (character name) and I'm here with (audience member names(s))..."" and we work in the information we've gleaned from the audience member.

It's been working well but we're looking for something new. Ideally, we're looking for something we can use as cold opening, but our primary goal is more audience interaction. I liked what the duo did in the above referenced post and I'd like to hear other suggestions.

I think it's an extremely interesting thing to learn, and I'd love to get good at it, so I'm looking for people who want to practice this with me.

You can take a look at the workshop I'm working on [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUgUqw6ewLsAgVsvtRy6DjCVue5aXK2ZI36JXaBe_SU/), and if you'd like to participate - come join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VYuQjszwrX). We'll be running our first session today, at 7PM GMT.

---

Disclaimer: I'm not an experienced improviser, let alone an improv teacher. I'm just a guy who wants to get better at improv, so I'm looking for fellow novice improvisers. Pattern Game is usually considered a challenging subject, and this workshop is still experimental. But I'm sure if we'll practice it a few times, we'll have lots of fun and figure out how to get a hang of this.

To particpate in this, you do need to understand the UCB Game-related concepts (Base Reality, First Unusual Thing, Heightening, and Justification). If you don't know what these things are, you should probably participate in our UCB Game workshop first.",Who wants to practice Pattern Game with me over Discord video chat?

improv,"Hey folks, we sure did some crazy improv skits this year. Just super funny, wild stuff, had me in tears. So I thought I'd share some of my favorites. These aren't the BEST skits, they're just my favorites, and we all know what a wacky sense of humor I have so you know! Hope I didn't forget anybody. Anyway, here goes!

1: The one that was real patient. It was Maggie and Josh and neither spoke for a solid minute and a half while they sized each other up, and then no one labeled anything for the rest of the scene. You could tell the audience was invested because nobody was laughing.

2: The one where Chris broke a chair and smashed a hole in the back wall. It started out with him just berating a woman and... No, you're thinking of the fourth time he did that, I'm thinking of the third.

3: I'm blanking on this one. I just remember Kevin did this look? Like, you know that look Kevin does? I think he was in a scene with Rachel and they were boyfriend/girlfriend or maybe just roommates or she was his mom... either way she said... what did she say? It doesn't matter, whatever it was, Kevin did his look. It was great.

4: The one that was pretty much all screaming.

5: That one group game that started out at the Running of the Bulls, but then we kept switching viewpoints between the people running and the bulls chasing them, and we found out that the bulls and the people were both scared, but like different kinds of scared, and I don't remember what happened next, like a bunch of things happened, but somehow there was like a Bull Revolution and then the Bulls had a Congress and passed Bull Laws and it ended with someone raising the Bull Flag for the Bull Pledge of Allegiance but the flag was all red so everyone went nuts? I guess you had to be there for that one.

Thanks for the laffs, gang. Seriously, you guys had me dieing each time watching you that I would forget to edit and the scene would go on forever. Looking forward to what you crazy stuff you do in 2023!",My favorite improv skits of the year

I would like to explore integrating audience participation into this type of improv and was wondering how the improv community deals with this in a practical way.

At one point I was thinking that an audience could use their smartphones to help generate a ""word cloud"" that could then be used as on-stage inspiration \*while\* the word cloud is being formed? I'm aware that apps like PollEverywhere and MentiMeter offer such functionality for student participation in classroom settings, but I'd like to know if other (more improv-suitable) methods are available that I'm not aware of.

- No degree in the art.
- Only took college courses many a moon ago.
- Have forgotten how to swim 4 times.
- Much experience as a nerd running on the spots skits in games for people and running trivia for friends and fam.
- I have a cat. She is very Chonk.
- Down learn from much more experience people when possible. A sort of yes and then improve skills as a team.

So not really any requirements besides being somewhat tech savvy since it would be a live stream event. Will have to vet folks to make sure the group works together well since easier to be funny with friends than frienemies.

improv,"She let cocaine be, but the subject of strippers I guess made her uncomfortable so she made us change the subject. I’ve never seen that happen before. 

I understand where she is coming from - that we should allow anyone to voice when they feel uncomfortable, but I feel like that should apply if you are in the hot seat and the scene directly applies to you and puts you in a situation that is traumatizing or hurtful. That was not the case here. She simply didn’t like the subject of strippers, so she cancelled what the newbie player said. 

I felt it was sort of shaming and I also feel that any aspect of life should be fair game, as long as it’s not infringing on someone’s physical or mental well-being.

We're a show called WizWorld LIVE, an improvised wizard talk show that airs every Friday. We are also insane enough to have a podcast version, with totally different interviews. It's a ton more work! Really foolish to add this burden to ourselves!! But BOY is it fun, and we're doing a new round of tapings!!!

We keep our episodes short. Total time commitment is usually about 25 minutes, with about 20 of that being actual recording. We do it like Comedy Bang Bang!, except one guest per ep. On the pod, basically, my cohost (Summersbane, evil necromancer) &amp; myself (Amoenus Franco, immortal mage) simply interview an interesting being. All you need to prep is a character name &amp; 1-2 sentences of a premise!

We record on Zencastr; you'll need a mic, headphones, &amp; stable Internet connection.

We're particularly looking for people with improv &amp; podcast experience, who like fantasy, &amp; like to have a fun collaborative time. I hope you'll submit!

In 2017 or so, an online friend dug up a kind of promotional preview or ad for an improv show if I recall correctly from 2011 or so. I'm sorry, I don't have the slightest clue where it was from (other than I'm pretty sure it was the US) or what the organization was called or anything.

It was styled as a kind of think tank. It dealt with stuff related to privacy and information control on the Internet. This was before things like Cambridge Analytica, so I think the ideas and attitudes they were dealing with were pretty novel to people and not quite as realistically threatening. I think what happened at a lot of these shows is they'd take interviews of experts talking about how e.g. ""the Internet is a large-scale spying machine"" and just GO OFF about ""misinformation agents"" and things--I recall two of the characters having an exchange where one said, ""There's no privacy online, is there?"" and another saying, ""I can have *privacy online*, as long as I *seed the Internet* with *misinformation about myself,* making posts about things I don't *care* about and sending messages to people *I don't even know!*"" thereby suggesting the only way to combat ""misinformation"" was to become a ""misinformation agent,"" to humorous effect! Most people would expect people to be generally pretty trustworthy, and doing such things as described as a waste of time!

improv,"I asked ChatGPT to write a story about improv theaters incorporating AI. The results were …not as dystopian as I expected:
===
#Once upon a time, in a world not too unlike our own, there was a bustling metropolis filled with theaters of all shapes and sizes. One of these theaters was home to a small but scrappy troupe of improvisational actors, who prided themselves on their quick thinking and ability to create laughs on the spot.

The troupe's leader, a wiry man named Jules, was always on the lookout for new ways to push the envelope and keep their shows fresh. So when a trendy new AI app hit the market, claiming to be able to help improv teams create even more creative and hilarious scenes, Jules was all over it.

He quickly downloaded the app and started using it at their weekly rehearsals. At first, the results were impressive - the app seemed to be able to come up with zany and unexpected ideas that the troupe never would have thought of on their own.

But as the weeks went by, Jules started to notice a strange trend. Every time they went to perform a new scene, it seemed like the audience had already seen something similar at another theater. And when Jules asked around, he discovered that nearly every other improv theater in the city was using the same AI app.

Panicked, Jules and the troupe decided to take legal action against the app's creators, claiming that their AI was ruining the uniqueness of their shows. But little did they know, every other theater was doing the same thing.

Before long, the city was filled with robots acting as lawyers, representing each theater in their legal battles against one another. The court cases went on for months, with no end in sight.

And in the end, there were no more theaters left in the city. The AI app had turned the vibrant, creative world of improv into a barren wasteland of litigation and robot lawyers.

But even in the darkest of times, Jules and the troupe refused to give up. They continued to perform, using their quick wits and boundless creativity to entertain the few remaining humans in the city.

And in the end, they proved that even the most advanced AI couldn't hold a candle to the power of human imagination.#",AI (Artificial Improv)

improv,"Just stumbled upon this subreddit by chance, I’ve never done improv or been a part of the community. Except once. Years ago, at summer camp, I was barred from going to archery because of an injury. Twice a week, we all went to different activities which we had picked out before the summer. I had picked archery, but these two  hours would have to be filled with something non-physical. Improv had the most room to fill.

I arrived at the building it was being held in, the third of three kids. Being young and hive-mind, “improv = lame” was all I could think. I was asked to do a scene with one of the other two kids, the clearly very enthusiastic one. He sat on a chair, and mimed playing the flute. Being the “yes and” contrarian I was, my first line was “why are you holding your baby like that?” I asked. I thought it was hilarious. “oh, um, baby mozart! I heard that showing a baby the motions of instrument playing is good for development”. Pretty smart, right? He was good at improv. “Oh, well, I think that that’s wrong”. The scene was ended early. Anyway sorry for that! I hope you’re on this sub and doing improv and loving it! I hope to atone for my sins to improv jesus (who I’m told is Colin Mochrie)

https://improvgames.io/files/Unscripted.pdf

This is a game for people who love collaborative storytelling, improvisation, and roleplay. It's like a combination of long-form improv and a roleplaying game. It has very simple rules, and can be played in 1-1.5 hours.

In this game you and your friends will take turns pitching story ideas, pick your favorite one, and then improvise scenes from this story.

So you can improvise a little micro-adventure with your friends, and roleplay through it in one session. Each player gets to brainstorm creative ideas, pitch awesome movie trailers, practice GMing and narrating awesome scenes, and practice roleplaying as characters in these scenes.

I've been dreaming about playing a game like this for a long time, and I think I finally figured out a set of simple rules that enable us to do all this. We've played it a bunch of times, and it was very fun!

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this game. If you have any ideas on how I could improve it - please share!","Unscripted - an improv-focused collaborative storytelling game where you improvise a fun story from scratch, with no preparation."

improv,"I'm one of the co-founders of Improv Jam. We're a small tech company building an Improv App.

Our MVP (that's like a first-to-market prototype) is a game where you get an AR mask, a scene idea, and perform a monologue.

As we build out the next version of our app, I'd be excited to understand which features you would want.

We'd love if you would rank the following ideas, tell us what you don't like, like best, and brainstorm things we didn't think of:

1. A social feed where you can upload all your improv content (Including ones made in the app), add friends who are improvisers, get followers, and comment on others' content.
2. Opportunity to win cash prizes by getting the most upvotes in using the app to make a video that gets the most likes on Instagram/TikTok, etc.
3. A way to have a live improv call with friends, where you get an improv scenario and possibly AR masks and record an improv scene that can be uploaded on TikTok or within the app's feed itself.
4. A way to earn cryptocurrency while you play the improv games, own the platform and make NFTs
5. A way to be able to submit new games and challenges to be played by friends.

Note that these ideas aren't all company directions, but we want to get outside advice from improvisers on which way we should be heading. I'm an improviser myself, so this is really important to me, and both my co-founder and I have the mission to help more people learn improv and have an easy way to do it every day.

improv,"Hey everyone! So I run an after school improv class for 8th graders and we recently started playing a game called Flashlight Sing. Here's a quick rundown of the game:

\- Class is split up into 3 groups of 4 or 5.

\- For each round of the game, I give them 3 categories (Ex. food, weather, transportation, holidays, etc.) and as a group they have 1 minute to come up with as many songs as possible that relate to each category (they may or may not write them down depending on the round).

\- After the 1 minute, I'll go around the room pointing randomly at each group and saying one of the 3 categories. That group then must immediately break into song and I assign 5, 3 or 0 points depending on how they do. Each group gets 5 turns per round.

\- The game typically lasts 5 round (time permitting). The last round is ""anything goes"" where the host can ask for any previous category from any previous round.

\- Finally, add up the scores and declare a winner.

We've played the game twice so far and I'm trying to think of new categories for songs. Does anyone have any ideas. Here's a sample of used categories:

* Commercial Jingles, USA, Money
* Spanish, Colors, TV Show Theme Songs
* Sports, Family Members, Halloween
* Water, Desserts, School Subjects
* U.S. States, Names, Seasons
* Transportation, Clothes, Christmas / Holidays
* Weather, Animals, Days of the Week, Food

On a side note, if you run any improv club or activity in a school setting I'd highly recommend this game. It's an instant favorite and my class let it slip that they've played it outside of school which I thought was really cute lol.

Thanks everyone!",Category ideas for a class game?

improv,"I’ve been doing improv just about every week for a year now, some short form but for the past several months, mostly Harolds. The guy who teaches improv in town and I started doing 2prov in June, and I have fallen in love with it.

We’ve performed for audiences some, but mostly 10 minute scenes (or shorter) with at most 3-4 characters. In private we’ve averaged 30-50 minutes with many more characters than that. 

We have gotten well enough at making sure we can keep up with each other’s character choices, but I fear there are times when (if we had an audience) they would not be able to keep the characters apart. 

I find it hard sometimes to fully commit to the character choices I try to make at the top. The more I’m focused on what’s happening, those choices seem to fall to the wayside. The characters all end up sounding like me. The scenes are still funny, but I wanna blow minds, ya know?

I’m specifically looking for advice at ways to superficially keep them apart. Having them each have their own “thing” goes a long way, but it’s the superficial stuff I’m struggling with. I’m thinking how in the TJ &amp; Dave “softball” show, things like the Beret, the subtle differences in tones of voice/pitch.

I have been going for improv jams regularly since September. The group delves in long-form improv (specifically the Harold).

I am an amateur improv actor who does this beautiful craft as a deep hobby. 

Some time ago we had a set of lessons with a master who was into psycholody. One of the classes involved few hours of various meditations to boost self conscience, like sets of ""what I want..."", ""what I see..."", ""what I think..."", ""what I feel..."" here and now. 

And at the very end of the course we had a following tast:

I've heard the common advice that you're not supposed to ""come up"" with the game, you're supposed to notice it when something unusual inevitably happens during your improv.

It might be useful for improv, but it's not as useful for writing sketches, it feels way harder to just start writing stuff and wait for any of it to just become unusual/funny, it just doesn't make sense to me.

improv,"Improvisers in this sub...

How do I start off strong in scenes and confidently?

I find I just come off as very uncertain and contribute little. When im in scenes I feel I am wishy washy and indecisive.


Let me give you an example. I felt I could have said more? My initial deal was to be submissive and inferior to my partner. I was daughter.

Sweep .


I noticedhow I felt in the scene. I was digging out of anxiety. I had no idea what was happening other than my father being domineering and berating me.

So I wanted to ask ,how do I come in strong next time I step into a scene. What questions should come to my head when I am in scene with someone?

Also for this scene... is it okay to talk very little and very quietly? Especially if your father is berating you in rants.

So far when I step into a scene, I know how I feel about someone when I step into a scene, and usually I know a relationship (father, mother, son, daughter etc).

In this scene when I stepped in, I knew I was going to be pathetic and my partner will have power over me


Also, is talking about the past or future necessarily a bad thing?

Suppose my father kept berating me, and instead of responding in the moment. I said something like ""by the time I reach my teens, I will discover what it means to be emo"" and after my father berates me more ""when I reach my twenties, I will be in my first relationship. But unbeknownst to me, he will berate me, just like my you father."" And the game is basically me psychoanalysing and predicting my own future as a consequence of my abusive father

improv,"I live in an area with a small but somewhat active improv scene. There are two other troupes that perform about once a month and tend to sell out their shows. They're pretty good.

I've had a group (11 so far, but growing) that hangs out once a week and does improv. Every week we rotate who is ""coaching"" and we've produced a show that sold 100+ tickets.

The problem is that we have hugely different skill levels. Some members were just friends that thought it looked fun, but some of us want to dive into some advanced long-form concepts and really push our skills. Right now I'm essentially ""leading"" this group, and I have to say that I want to do more advanced stuff too. I'd love to become a regular troupe in this region, but I'm not proud of the improv that 3 or 4 of our members are doing.

**Do we keep inexperienced people on who are really excited and eager to learn? Or do we cut down to a focused/core group?**

With that in mind, the fact that we're all coaching each other is starting to be an issue. I hate being a player and also telling people what they should do differently. I also have a really hard time setting goals for the troupe, since we don't officially have a coach or an artistic director assigned.

improv,"Hi! Curious for some other opinions and thoughts. I'm just starting out on my improv journey. I have social anxiety, which has made it hard to build and maintain strong relationships over my 43 years. Also, I tend to shut down in social situations, and have a REALLY hard time thinking on my feet, even just in normal conversation, and so improv seemed like a good way to push some of my boundaries. 

I signed up for an Improv Level 1 class with a local improv school/hub here in town, and have finished 3 of the 5 weeks. Overall it's been great fun, and a great group of people with whom I feel safe to experiment and fail. But I've noticed as we've gotten further along that many of the others have skills that I just don't. I find it really hard to come up with a character and respond to situations in a convincing way as that character. I'm pretty inhibited still and find it hard to be effusive and highly emotive, like some of my classmates can do easily. And I don't know a lot about pop culture, so things like being Harry Potter at a party, or telling a story in the style of Kim Kardashian are really hard for me. I've had to do things like that and no one could guess who I was, because I didn't know enough about the characters to drop decent hints!

So I'm finding I'm feeling more and more self-conscious as we move on to more elaborate character and scene work. I'm really worried about our Level 2 class which goes right into long-form improv. I'm just not sure I'll be able to do it. And I guess I'm wondering if I wouldn't be better off moving on and finding some other way to challenge myself. All that said, I'd be sad if that happened as I think, if I can get the hang of this and start making real contributions to the scenes I'm in, it will really help me and be boatloads of fun at the same time.

I'm curious about other people's experiences, and/or suggestions... hopefully suggestions that don't involve binge-watching the Kardashians!

improv,"So recently I have learned a UCB technique where you shouldn't (or try not to) follow the plot of the scene, but rather take the character to the most interesting place/worst/funniest place for that character to be. 

I struggle with this so much. Once ina while I'll see a character and be like 'oh yes I know where we should put him/her.' But mostly I just panic on the sides wanting to edit but not knowing where to take the character (we are doing a la ronde by the way.) 

In The past if I was on the sides and watching a scene and someone in the scene says something like ""well at least it was better than my crazy birthday party."" I would tag out one character and bring the other character to the birthday party. Or ""my dad doesn't let me go to the movies by myself,"" and I would tag out and become his father at the movies.. But our coach has been saying to follow the character not the plot. If they talk about something in a scene , don't cut to it, and don't talk about it in the next scene.

When does a game or want become unrealistic and a block to progressing a scene forward.

It worked first few times but at some point one of the student in the scene got injured.

 rather than turning that offer into an important one, I ended up dismissing the offer by telling the kids that ""this is blood, lets take notes everyone!"".

I felt the offer of kis being injured just became overlooked, not to mention I felt like a flat character. 

Another example: I was relaxed at home. My wife is sick of my relaxed behavior. I was so relaxed that I didnt want to get up to eat and had her feed me.

improv,"Hi, I built an Android app that combines Both improvisations and writing. It's called Tell Me A Story, an almost gamified version of improv storytelling similar to the stories you find online, However, there is one twist, you are not the sole creator of the story, you get to continue writing from other peoples stories and carry on topics you may not be comfortable with, improving your writing and improvisational skills. The idea came from a couple of friends who love writing and reading these made up stories so I decided to give them a platform specifically to express their creative concepts with. They've been giving me some good feedback and it is pretty fun for them to write and me to read. I have been working on this program for nearly the entire summer and would like to give it to the internet to have fun with, as of right now developing this isn't my full-time job but if enough interest is generated for TMAS I will gladly continue this project and improve it far past its current state. I will be taking suggestions for features and adjustment to the current format from the community as this is developed, a lot of what has been created is the result of my two friends feedback on the program.

improv,"I had an audition recently that didn't go too well. It wasn't by any means embarrassing, but I clearly was struggling on stage and just didn't feel like myself. I'll be shocked if I'm called back. 

I've been improvising for the better part of a year and a half or so and have taken several classes and have been in a long-form troupe, in addition to performing in jams and one-off shows and that sort of thing. I recently moved, and it sort of feels like I'm starting over a bit, having to learn new people, etc. I was a bit hesitant at auditioning today because of that (my improv muscles have atrophied a bit since moving due to less stage time and practice), but I got a slot and figured I'd give it a go. 

Anyway, the audition didn't go too well, nor have a couple other auditions I've had in the past for other spots. It's really discouraging since I think I have the talent, but I just can't put it together when it counts. I sort of freeze up on stage and stumble a bit when auditioning. So I'm left feeling very discouraged and am wondering if I should even keep up doing this. I find improv very fun and it's a passion, but I'm wondering if I hit a wall in terms of growth and I'm anxious about finding new friends to perform with now that I've moved. It's just daunting. 

Are there any tips on how to get better at auditions? What are things I could work on in classes or jams? And if anyone has any tips on picking improv back up after moving to a new city, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",Improving at auditions

improv,"I feel like I'm always making weak choices. Not always, but I have been feeling this a lot lately. It is difficult for me to intuitively understand in a scene if it's more important to unpack and expand the characters/world... or if I should hit something gamey and just have a fun scene. I keep getting the opposite note. I know this is just another improv hurdle... I make good choices too and I dont think my bad choices necessarily ruin the scene/show (at least not all of them!) But it could have been so much better and it could have created more things for my team to play with if I would have went the other way. 

I know its always a little of both (game &amp; fleshed out characters)... but sometimes a scene calls more for one specific approach... and I hate when I go down the wrong path.

improv,"I saw an interview recently with Lauren Lapkus, and her comments on improv irritated me.  It was the interview someone shared here in which she said there's a lot of people doing bad improv out there, and basically saying she wished people would avoid it/stop.


I think her comment is kind of shit.  She operates under the assumption that there are those worthy of improv and those not.  In many ways, she is treating improv like classical music...where expensive training and raw talent shine above all else.


In my opinion, I view improv more like folk music.  Anyone can pick-up a guitar and express themselves.  Bob Dylan was not the most technically sophisticated musician, but because he spoke from the heart he resonated with the people.  Same with any kid blowing on a glass jug or playing a beat up guitar/banjo.  


Clearly, I think that Bob Dylan is technically less impressive than, say, Beethoven.  But there is something magical in an art-form that allows any jag-off from the street to get on stage and make people laugh.


The beauty of improv, to me, is not the skill of any single troupe or performance, but it's the hive-mind.  It's the law of averages.  That if you bring together enough people, not even great people...together they will smooth over each other's flaws and make something wonderful.


It's similar to a children's school recital.  Most kids in your class are not great singers...but when everyone sings at once...it sounds listenable.  It's not Adele or Idina Menzel...but it's got it's own charm.

improv,"Hi all, speaking off the cuff here: I've been granted mod powers, and the only big change I'd like to make is to clarify in the sidebar exactly what kind of improv we're talking about. But before I make a big change like that, I want to know what you think about that and also how you would word that definition. My hope is to have something that welcomes and encompasses all brands and styles of theatrical improv, and makes it clear that this isn't the correct place for piano/dance videos. I'd also like to encourage a healthy amount of bits, emphasis on *healthy amount.* I don't want that to get overwhelming. I want people to have fun, to realize when things are jokes, and also make it clear when they tell a joke too. I'm not sure how to get that across in a way that doesn't risk devolving into a gaggle of bonerz.

improv,"So I have no experience in comedy, acting, theater or being on stage in general (except for playing gigs with my band in high school). Last week, I went to a free intro workshop thing at the improv theater in my city. I was pretty nervous and didn't know what to expect. When I got there and the instructor asked if anyone had improv experience and no one raised their hand, I felt relieved that I wan't the only newb. 

We went right into what appeared to be basic improv games. I felt incredibly silly and a little uncomfortable being a weirdo in front of a circle of strangers. The silly games continued for the next two hours, with everyone gradually getting more comfortable. At times, we all gave each other pretty big laughs. I volunteered to create a scene with another person and it felt so natural and was so so so much fun. We even got a couple big laughs. At the end, it seemed like everyone had a great time, including me. As self-conscious as I felt, at the end of the class I realized that all of my stress had gone away. A few of us ending up talking at the end and exchanged numbers. We started a group chat so we could take the same Improv 101 class. When I walked out, I felt happier and more content than I had in a long time. It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off of me and I felt like I was floating. I'm a pretty depressed and anxious person so this was a great feeling. My girlfriend was waiting for me outside and she saw it in my face. She said she rarely sees me glow like that. 

So I start my first class of eight this Thursday. I'm so excited. I have a feeling that this could be my thing. It feels so good to have made friends in this already. I rarely make new friends. I'm looking forward to being silly with a group of equally silly people for two hours a week. I'm just having a lot of good feelings about this. I hope that I can become a part of your community.

improv,"Hoping this is the right place to ask!

I'm running a team meeting in a couple of weeks and rather than just doing the boring stats and strategy etc etc, I'd like to shake things up and get everyone doing something a bit different. We are a small team working within a much larger department and wider business, making outbound calls to retailers as sales representatives. It's not exactly selling - but we are looking after the people who sell our products and encouraging them to sell better.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience of doing corporate improvisation sessions, using drama and improv to help increase team unity whilst also exploring good customer service, listening skills, communication, empathy, that kind of thing. There is a big focus in the business at the moment around making every contact with our customers and clientele brilliant, and I really think that doing some improv and workshopping will prove astronomically useful in this regard.

improv,"Within the past month or so we've seen an influx of troll posts and users. Most of which, just seem to want to get a rise out of us for some weird reason. (Like why /r/improv? We're a pretty small community). For the most part I appreciate the laissez faire approach you guys have to moderating. Even with the influx of troll posts, I think its pretty reasonable to downvote, ignore, and move on. I'm not a big fan of banning users or content especially in a community as small as ours.

With that being said, 8 days ago I made a post on this subreddit. It was an obvious bit post. I will totally admit it was pretty blue, crude, and may not have been everyone's cup of tea in terms of humor. The question was ""What is your favorite improv sex position?"". I gave a pretty graphic description of mine in the text post to show it was totally a joke. I can understand if you thought it went too far and thus took it down - However, I feel that's kind of a fucked up thing to do considering its not something often done to posts here. In addition it really irks me that I wasn't even sent a message or anything telling me that my post was taken down, or WHY it was taken down.

I am obviously not a troll. I've been a pretty active member of this community since October 2015, on this account at least. Though, I followed this sub when I began improv on an older account back in 2012. My point is that I obviously care about this place and community. I don't ONLY submit bit posts. In fact the vast majority of my contributions to this sub are comments giving advice. I write entire novels here in the comment section because I care about helping people, I care about expressing opinions (not just my own), and I care about discussing this amazing artform. But I also really like to have fun. And it seems like we can no longer do that here by posting bits.

I've been going back and forth on whether to post something about this or not. But with the looks of the current front page on this sub with posts about ""improv and thirst"" - where the OP asks us how we deal with all the attractive improv girls we want to fuck. That post, that is pretty damn misogynistic, stays up. Yet, my joke post gets taken down. It just kind of struck a nerve.

I don't feel like my post was 'offensive' at all. However, I'll own up to it being low-brow, blue, and crude. I don't think thats a valid reason to take it down, but I can understand and live with it if I crossed some line (though I have no idea what that line is).

I want to reiterate that I don't think y'all are bad guys. I just want a little transparency is all. Maybe we should have a larger discussion on what content we want to see here and how we want the mods to deal with 'bad' content.

TLDR;
My ""What's your favorite improv sex position?"" bit post got taken down without a message or reason as to why. Yet there are some pretty troll-y / controversial posts (most notably the one on 'improv and thirst') that have stayed up.","Hey mods, what's going on?"

improv,"Hiiiii friends. So I've been improvising for two and a half years. The past year has been full of wonderful times in a class troupe that I love and have felt very safe and supported and playful in. But....then some life shit happened and I lost a couple of auditions that classmates won and I became very depressed. Improv had been my escape the past couple of years...my thing that always brought joy, my thing that didn't matter too much (not precious), and now it just feels so heavy and precious and the pressure to improve as an improvisor became unbearable. I cracked last weekend and realized I dreaded every class, every show, and couldn't laugh anymore when I was in the audience. Throw in some suicidal ideation and I had myself a bad situation that I knew I needed to step back from. UGH.

So...I have quit classes for now, taken a step back from my other troupes, and I feel lost. I don't want to quit forever, but I just couldn't stand the pressure anymore (self-induced pressure, I will admit). I'm afraid I won't return to it, and am so sad that my mental illness (depression! Woo!) has gotten in the way of something I truly love(d).

 the coached ensemble auditions this weekend.  The instructions say to bring a ""theater resume"".  I've searched posts in this subreddit about said resumes and I feel like I get the jist of what goes on there.

Name, physical descriptions, theater experience/past shows, and skills.

The problem is, I don't have any prior theater experience outside of the Second City classes I've been taking.

So ultimately, I guess I was just wondering how much I can reach on my resume as far as experience goes?  For example, in High School (I'm 20 by the way, so I'm not too far removed from it) I was in the pit orchestra for our winter musicals and I won a poetry slam with a comedic poem amongst my sophomore class (around 700ish people).  My logic is that pit orchestra at least exposed me to the theatrical environment and the poetry slam, although just a one time thing, counts as performance and writing experience.

And also, since I'm writing this, what constitutes skills?  I've seen examples in past posts that instruments, accents, and physical abilities are all good things to put on there.  So would it make sense for me to put the fact that I can play saxophone on their? Or would that be silly?  The reason I ask is that I don't really see the relevance in regards to improv.

improv,,Imagenes de Amor con Frases Android-Apps auf Google Play
improv,"I’ve been asking teams and students a question recently.

I ask them to pay attention to specific actions they might see on stage at an improv show:

* Stopping
* Avoiding
* Delaying

Great improv scenes represent of some activity: fixing a car, eating meal, breaking up, talking to your boss, making an arrest. Absent of some activity, scenes devolve into detached talking heads performances.

The core of a great scene is: people in a place doing a thing for a reason.

The next time you’re at a show, keep an eye out for when the performers stop, avoid, and delay the thing they're  characters are there to do.

Sometimes stopping can be very in your face. In a scene at a restaurant players might ignore their food by the end.

Improvisers can be highly skilled at inventing all kinds of reasons to avoid or delay the action of the scene. Very popular tactics include: It’s everybody’s first day, nobody knows how to do anything, somebody’s dad died, and frequently some tool is missing from the spare-tire kit.

In addition to looking for these in other shows, pay attention to your own play. Are you stopping, avoiding, and delaying?

What can be done to avoid SAD improv? One of the original Kitchen Rules says to make active choices.

When the activity of a scene has been established we’re given a lot of material to work with. TJ &amp; Dave talk about doing “the next little thing”. If we know what we’re doing, we have a lot of actions we can take next.

I like to think of those images of the average face. They strip away everything that could be unique about a face. If we think of our scenes as having a labeled activity, we can think of a hypothetical average scene. Layer all the _getting ready to go out_ scenes on top of each other and average them out. What is still in the average scene? What actions can we make out when all the unique versions of that scene blend together?

* Tying ties
* Adjusting jewelry
* Applying makeup
* Looking in the mirror
* Brushing teeth/mouthwash
* Blowdrying hair
* Getting wallet, keys, watch
* Using the toilet

That’s just the most obvious stuff and there’s definitely enough to do to last as long as you need it to. One could blow through those at an hurried pace of 30 seconds each and still have a four minute scene.

Pay attention to activities in scenes and how much stopping, avoiding, and delaying you see, and maybe even do yourself.","Stopping, avoiding, and delaying in scenes"

improv,"I want to preface this entire thing by saying that I know that I have a lot to learn (and always will, which makes this whole form so great)!

Some friends and I founded a troupe at my University last Fall, to differing levels of success. We've gotten good reception on campus, performed at the local Comedy Club, and have gained a decent chunk of traction. Our roster is floating, with 10-12ish consistent people showing up to what amounts to open jams 2 days a week. Given that it's currently summer, we meet once a week, and only for the people who are in our college town over the summer. It's been okay for the most part, but I feel like we're starting to hit a rut. Basically, I'm not the person ""in charge"" of the troupe, but I'm not particularly happy with the direction we're going in.


It feels as though the general demeanor has shifted, both in the sense of personal relationships and intent with the troupe. We've all gotten very close, which is wonderful. But at the same time, our closeness has kind of turned rehearsals into ""fuck-around-with-friends-time."" I don't deny that some of this is due in part to semi-common get-togethers where the plan is to get drunk and do nothing as a troupe. I feel like there are certainly members of the troupe who feel similarly, but I feel as though there is a divide between what people want out of the group . 


I've been doing my best to improve (taking some local improv classes over the summer, listening to Improv podcasts, attending weekly open jams outside of our group), and grow as an improviser. I really truly love doing improv, and it's helped me a lot in breaking out of my shell; I just feel as though I've reached a point where I want to keep improving, and our current set-up just isn't helping. 


To elaborate, we've done workshopping and scene-study in the past, but that's fallen to the wayside in a few different ways. We have a tendency to not let scenes progress naturally, and wipe them after a single joke (or to have 3 people jump in, with 4 scenes occurring simultaneously, basically succumbing to a bunch of noise). Similarly, we'll often get stuck in our own running jokes that have been disillusioning to people joining up late in the game. We had 13 people play at a recent performance, and it was an absolute mess; there was just too many people trying to do too many things at the same time. The person conducting ""auditions"" for this performance refused to cut anyone, despite us receiving notice that our performing team should not exceed 8 players. 


At the same time, I see people in our troupe who just haven't really improved in the span of our existence. I understand that different people take to improv in different ways, but after consistently being blocked in a scene by someone who's been doing improv with us for 6 months, it becomes frustrating. **I cannot stress enough that these people are my friends and have shaped my college experience so much for the better.** At the same time, I just feel trapped in my situation. I want to bring up these concerns to the person who facilitates our troupe, but I don't want to step on his toes or cause in-fighting. 


Given that we never had an actual audition process (with cuts), my thought process was that it might be beneficial to break into two smaller teams for people interested in short-form and long-form respectively (since we currently just do both whenever it suits us), and then audition some incoming Freshman to change up the dynamics. As I understand it, the current plan is to just keep doing what we're doing, and I don't know if I can keep with it. 


I'm not trying to be elitist or selfish, please forgive me if it comes across as such. I just feel stuck and I don't want to hurt anyone. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

improv,"Now I know that to be a straight man in a scene is to completely try and hold the objective view of society and point out the absurdity in any situation. However, I've been having a lot of trouble being a good straight man in scenes as of late. 

For context, my predisposition is to usually go for the absurd and/or play the other pea in a ""peas in a pod"" scene but I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone and become more fleshed out as an improvisor. 

I recently did a show where while we received laughs, I felt awkward as the straight man in a few particular scenes as I couldn't properly articulate what the absurd part of the scene was and I didn't feel as supportive to my stage partner as I could have been. How do I go from injecting the absurdity in the scene to being a good supportive straight man? 
I seem to be having a lot of trouble in finding the simple ""silliness"" in a scene and highlighting it. Often i end up getting inside my head during a scene from which I just start stuttering nonsense- which doesn't add to the relationship between my character and my scene partner/s as well as unsuccessfully being a good wall for them to keep throwing more and more absurd things my way for me to swat back.

improv,"[A bit over a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/6lfxbz/help_me_name_some_improv_forms_that_dont_exist/) I asked for suggestions of improv forms that don't exist for an event we call Form Jam. We had the jam last night and it was a huge success.

Here are the games we played and descriptions of each. Most of them are short form games but some of them are more longform in nature. Thanks again to everyone for the suggestions!

**Take It Elsewhere -** Players do a normal scene. At any time, the host may call ""Take it elsewhere"" and get a suggestion from the audience as to the new location. Players continue the scene as if it has always taken place at that location.

**The Klein Bottle -** Players do a normal scene. Using an improv suggestion app, the host can call out ""add essence of &lt;suggestion&gt;"" at any time and players must continue the scene by adding that element but without calling attention to it. Host may also give individual players new essences to incorporate.

**Jorge Posada's Daydream -** Three players take the position of a batter, catcher, and umpire. The catcher starts telling a story about a dream they had, which all players then tag to and act out. When the players return to the batting scene, they switch positions until all players have had a chance to tell a daydream story.

**Freeze Dodgeball -** An all play game played like Freeze Tag. Two players start a scene. At any time, a player not in the scene can yell ""freeze"", at which the players stop the scene and stop moving. They then attempt to tag a player in the scene with the ball. If the player is hit, whoever threw the ball takes the exact pose of the player they're replacing and initiates a new scene. If the player dodges the ball, the scene continues but players must justify whatever new position they find themselves in after dodging. If the player catches the ball, whoever threw the ball must enter the scene as a new character. Head hits don't count, just like normal dodgeball.

**World's Worst (but not the shortform version) -** An audience member tells the story of a very memorable day in their lives. The players then show the complete worst version of that day.

**The Hedge Maze -** Players start a monoscene. Once the scene reaches a boiling point or edit-worthy moment, someone sweeps the stage. Whoever sweeps repeats a line of dialogue that they said earlier in the scene, and now we see a new ""branch"" or ""path"" that the scene could have taken from that point. Players can sweep and re-start the scene from any line of dialogue at any time to see a new path.

**Universal Constants -** Players do a roughly 1 minute scene, after which the host calls time. The host then picks one aspect of the scene to remain constant (a pose, a relationship, a character voice, anything) and the players do a totally new scene with that previously established constant as part of the new scene. The host then repeats, adding more constants that carry over from scene to scene (so if a pose was set as a constant in scene 1, that pose will continue throughout all following scenes)

**Where Will Christ Show Up? -** Three players each get a suggestion of a fictional god and two aspects they represent. They then do a Family Dinner-style scene until a fourth player decides to crash the party as Jesus.

**Facebrain Hooplah -** Another hosted game. Players start a scene and at any time the host can call a player's name and then one of the following: Face: the player must incorporate a facial expression and strong emotional reaction into their next line of dialogue. Brain: the player must reveal a secret about their character. Hooplah: the player must throw out a non-sequitur or other random line of dialogue that is then justified.

**Short Story Long -** An audience member starts telling a story but the moment the story starts to get interesting (within 2-3 sentences) the players thank them for their time and then act out the story they haven't heard.

**Interesting! -** Players start a scene with one player on the sidelines. When one of the players in the scene says something the waiting player likes, they say ""Interesting!"" and then repeat the thing they found interesting about what was said. They then replace the other player in the scene and start a whole new scene with the player who said the interesting line of dialogue.

**Fairytale Beginnings -** Players get a suggestion of things that landed them in jail. They then do a scene where they talk about how their perfect upbringing somehow led them naturally to commit this crime.

**Jiminy Cricket -** Two players do a scene with a third on the sidelines. When someone says something that seems untruthful, the third player says ""That doesn't sound right, let's see what really happened/what they really meant/etc."" and players jump to see what really happened. We then cut back to the first scene and both characters now know the truth.

**Not Quite -** Players do a scene, and then the host edits and says ""That's not quite what happened. What was different about this scene?"" and the audience can call out suggestions of what was different (two players were actually spies, one of the characters is mute, etc.). The scene is repeated.

**Hourglass Martini -** Played similar to Countdown. Players do a one minute scene, a 30 second version of that scene, a 15 second version of that scene, and then a 1 second version of that scene. Players then go back up, doing 15 second, 30 second, and 1 minute versions of the scene. The twist is that the characters need to become progressively more drunk as players work their way back up to the 1 minute scene, at which point they should be completely hammered.

**Center Central -** It's like a monoscene + dime store novel. Players start a monoscene in which they each tell stories, as they start their story the other two players stand up and act it out. The player telling the story can add or change aspects of the story as it's acted out. Repeat until all players have told a story.

**Spooky Action at a Distance -** Players get a suggestion of a party that would be really cool or fun to go to and then play the most Debbie-Downer-type characters that might be at that kind of party.",I asked you for improv forms that don't exist. Here are the results!

I've been practicing improv with a partner for some time now. We've both been preforming improv off/on for 4-5 years now. Mainly a part of a larger troupe, but we've been recently working on a two-hander.

I apologize if I'm explaining this poorly or using the wrong terminology, but we either get stuck in scenes or they go flat at practice.
It's like we're able to set-up the details (who/where/what), but struggle with the action/progression of the scene. For example we can to a point where know we are siblings in a haunted mansion looking for ghosts, and then we freeze.

Are there any exercises/things we can do at practice to help us get better at this? Do you think the problem could be fixed through a better understanding of a Skill we are lacking in?

So my question is, and I know there is no right answer, but would it be a stronger choice for the wife to react truthfully- ""Jeff I know we met here at this starbucks, but its a little weird to bring me here on our anniversary- you promised me dinner."" 

OR would it be more interesting for the wife to play ""Oh hunny! My Favorite place! You are so romantic. What are we eating?""

I guess my question is how do you know when to play a voice of reason (straight character) and when to play the opposite of what the audience expects? I'm not sure if this is just UCB style vs Chicago style improv or what but I am a little confused.

For those who don't know, DSI is a comedy club in Chapel Hill, NC. Originally just improv, they branched out and included standup and sketch as well. Brief background on myself: I've been performing since 2008. I took some classes there and performed with a few teams a few years ago, but it was never my home theater.

Last year, there was a mass exodus from DSI. There was a lot of talk going around about some shit owner Zach Ward had pulled concerning women at the club. This was an email he sent to the staff: http://imgur.com/a/zK4DZ

Earlier this week, a good friend of mine, Vinny, the former associate director at DSI, made a Facebook post about some of Zach's actions in terms of where performers were allowed to do shows. This spiraled into many people telling stories about Zach's improprieties. [Note: any Facebook posts here are public]

This led to some crew members leaving: https://www.facebook.com/eric.grosskurth/posts/10212665874303689

Zach responded with this post on a private group for DSI members: http://imgur.com/a/ADxVY

This was the post that set me off. It was one thing hearing stories from people I either didn't know, or had vaguely met at a show, but this post by my friend Grace made me physically ill: https://www.facebook.com/yourfriendgrace/posts/10100384359367805?pnref=story

Apology, this is where I no longer have screen shots, as people were just sharing text with me. Zach sent this email to the DSI community yesterday:

Statement from Zach Ward

DSI,

I have been made aware of the Facebook post by Grace Baldridge Carnes. I continue to be contacted by mutual friends, colleagues and members of the community who are reaching out to make sure I am aware of the post and to express their support. For that, I am grateful. Many of these people were/are aware of the details of my past relationship with Grace. I am just as shocked and confused by the post as many of those who have reached out to me to express their disbelief.

Grace and I had many things in common, finding each other at a time when we were both dealing with marriages that didn't work out and learning the ropes of single parenting. We had a very amicable end to our romantic relationship and continued to be friends for over a year. We had sexual intercourse on several occasions, always consensual, as adults in a romantic relationship often do. When the relationship deteriorated, I stopped returning her messages, many of which were sexual in nature and others were increasingly agitated. I blocked her on social media which is why I did not see the post until alerted by concerned friends.

The post describes a sexual encounter in a manner that includes completely fabricated details leading a reader to believe that a sexual assault occurred. I can understand how those not familiar with the relationship between me and Grace would, based on that post, believe that it was a one night stand with allegations that literally make me sick. These are not allegations that I take lightly. They are serious and they are absolutely false. The sexual encounter in the Facebook post simply did not take place as Grace described.

While I am humbled by the support of my friends and colleagues, especially those who know all the details of my past relationship with Grace, the post still upsets me, confuses me, and leaves me wondering how someone could fabricate such an event that some women actually experience way too often.

These false allegations have already taken a toll on my personal wellbeing as well as my business. DSI is my passion and life's work. I have met many great people through my involvement with improv comedy. I have endeavored to cultivate an environment of safety, inclusion, and tolerance at DSI. I have addressed head on any issues that have been brought to my attention and I take them seriously.

We have postponed shows previously scheduled for this week so our staff and performers can ask questions and reset. Cast members can reach out to directors about rehearsals. We look forward to camps, classes and shows next week.

-----

Finally, I woke up this morning to find that he sent this email: 

DSI,

Considering the content and tone of recent conversations, for the health of the community and a possible future for the theater, I have decided to remove myself from all theater operations, taking an indefinite leave from DSI and comedy effective Monday July 10th. It is my sincere hope that the community will continue to produce great work, no longer divided, and that the comedians and artists who have worked to help build DSI since 2003 will continue to do so, for each other.

I am aware of the Facebook conversation started by Vinny Valdivia and I have heard those who say that I hurt them. I am sorry. I have only ever wanted people to be happy and feel safe. I recognize now that, at least for a lot of people who participated in that conversation, some of whom I (sadly) haven't seen for over a decade, the cloud around me has become the largest threat to what DSI stands for: Community, built on positivity, optimism and unconditional support.

I am genuinely sorry for the impact my relationships and my leadership have had on the theater and our community. I have been truly grateful for the opportunity to have supported such a special space for comedy in North Carolina, working with some of the most incredible students and inspiring performers in the country.
How does this work.

Public operations (shows, public classes and cast rehearsals) have been postponed this weekend, 7/6-7/8, and next weekend, 7/13-7/15. 

Like a Girl Comedy Festival, scheduled Thursday 7/27 - Sunday 7/30, has been postponed indefinitely. Artist messages will be sent tonight.

An update on a theater leadership transition, one where Zach Ward will no longer be the owner of DSI, will be sent by 7pm Monday 7/10.

In the very least, DSI has a commitment to parents and students to run summer camps and classes through the end of August. These classes and camps will be administered by School Director Brandon Holmes.
Weekend operations (shows and cast rehearsals) could resume after a new leadership team are able to assess casts and potential programming.

There are details to work out, but I wanted to make sure that my intention to step down from DSI and turnover the theater was clear ―and that I sent this message sooner rather than later. I have never wanted people to feel this much pain. I want the company to come out of limbo, if possible, so the community can heal.

I appreciate that they are beginners but I previously did a course with a different group and that had a much better vibe - it felt safe and supportive. Right now, I feel really uncomfortable around my teammates.

improv,"Hi everyone. I'm starting improv level 1 classes next month and I'm excited about it. My only experience is from professional wrestling. I did it for a little over 10 years and had several different characters. Unfortunately I was never on television(only did independent/small shows) but I had so many fun opportunities and memories of improvising on camera and in front of live audiences as these made up characters. But I know improv is a different ball game and it's a new experience that I respect and am excited to become a part of.

But I have to be honest, I'm nervous. While it may not be weird to so many of you, it's weird to me that I was rarely nervous in front of big crowds when I was talking and performing in the ring yet the idea of being on stage does make me a bit nervous. I've always been humble yet confident in myself to perform, but just the different atmosphere of improv makes me have that nerve-wracking feeling. Regardless, I am stoked to become a part of improv and learn as much as I can.

improv,"The comedy club I take classes at now teaches long form, primarily the Harold. I'm in 301 and I pretty much have the basics down and I have my grounded characters down really solid, but the one thing I've been struggling with lately is playing the unusual well. I either draw blanks and can't think of a good pattern quick enough or when I do, I have trouble jumping directly into the scene. 

There's another club in my city that does short form game based improv, I've been to a couple shows and realized that in short form there's never really any just standing-talking scenes. Due to the nature of short form improv games it's pretty much all action from the very start of the scene. 

So my question is would learning short form benefit me playing the unusual character in a Harold. Would it condition me to jump into a scene with more energy? Also I'm open to any other tips from anyone else who has struggled with playing the unusual in the past.

So I've been doing Improv for the past decade on and off. But around 7 or 8 years ago I found myself unable to really keep up with a troupe. Being in the navy, moving around and working the odd weekend will do that.

A friend of mine got me involved in Larping while I was in Pensacola and I realized how many similarities there are between playing a character all weekend at a game and long form improv. I've been using larp since then to practice and hone my skills.

1. Have any of you also had experience using larp for improv improvement and if so, how have you found it?

2. For those familiar, what advanced skills would you recommend practicing?

It's been interesting trying to make scenes work and supporting narratives when the other people involved don't necessarily have the same background or understanding of how to positively and productively contribute.

improv,"I moved to a small community and started a drop-in, improv jam club about a year and a half ago. We started in someone's living room and now rent a space for 2 hours every week where we meet and practice. It costs $3 to drop in, which all go towards the space rental. Although we are all amateurs, usually one of us will facilitate and decide what warm-ups and games we are going to do. Our club has about 60 members but maybe only a dozen of those people show up semi-regularly, with a few really dedicated members.

Things have been going along pretty well, considering, but lately there have been things that are becoming frustrating:

Members tend to show up at 7, when practice is scheduled to begin, and then chit chat with each other for 15 minutes before they will settle down to start to practice. I have already added a 10 minute break in the middle of the two hours and we usually go for beer after club. I have offered to get to the space to open it early so people can hobnob before practice, but people say they're ""too busy"" and can only come at 7. I put a lot of work into getting this club going and I'm frustrated ate the erosion of time spent actually doing improv. It started as 2 hours and is now down to 1:35. Also, as people figure out that we don't actually start until 10 or 15 minutes after, they start arriving later and later. Part of our agreement with the space is we keep the front door locked, so every late arrival is a disruption.

I see this as a matter of adulthood and integrity. You don't show up at yoga and then waste 15 minutes of everybody's yoga time by refusing to settle down and begin.

Another issue that is happening is some people are complaining about how other people facilitate. To me, if you're the one holding the shovel, you decide where the hole will be dug. In other words, if someone decides to facilitate, they get to decide what to focus on and what games to play. Anybody is welcome to facilitate, so if they have an idea of how they want it done they should do it that way.

The third issue is some of us have started performing publicly with each other and it makes awkward politics with people who aren't invited to participate for whatever reason. This is a drop in club where anybody can go to jam and we don't always jive with each others styles.

I'm looking for advice on howto handle the politics of the facilitation and feelings.

I am also looking for advice about how to deal with the time issue. I want to draw up a brief set of agreements that can guide the club which includes an agreement to start and finish on time, but I don't want to do it all on my own because that seems dictatory. (I have tried twice to form a board of directors for the club and have only had a few takers). I am considering calling a ""general meeting"" where everyone can attend but I also consider the time thing to be non-negotiable. I have worked very hard to get this club going, I have produced professional workshops where I hired and arranged professional improvisors to come in, I produced our fundraiser (which took me 4 days), found affordable practice space and have been there every week for consistency, all because *I just want to practice some improv*. I wanted 2 hours a week, I can accept 1:50, but I didn't do all this to facilitate people's need for social interaction.
How can I get them to understand that if 10 people start 15 minutes late we are wasting a cumulative 2 and a half hours?

I am not a very good communicator and need a way to present this where people are open to listening and also, hopefully, agreeing. Any advice?

Just wanted to know your experience with a coach, was it worth it? Did it take time to find the right one? How much did you and your team pay? Any stellar coach recommendations around the area? Amateur things to avoid? Etc. Etc. 

Thanks!

improv,"I am completely new to improv in a sense. I am not necessarily posting here for self promotion, but that wouldn't hurt. I am mainly posting here to see what you guys think we could improv in our podcast. It's a podcast where a friend of mine and I make up an occupation and throw in a ""wildcard"" for eachother, and then we make up a character. We then have 12 minute rounds (which is changing in the next episode being recorded tonight) to make each other laugh enough to break character.

I'm really here to ask for some advice. I have been watching videos on youtube for improv things, but it's a lot about using your body, and gestures to help. While we do that stuff, it's not seen. So what are some suggestions you might have on making us better?

improv,"Hey y'all. So I lived in LA for a couple years and did improv there (graduated an improv program at iO West and was on a team at a smaller theater too.) I'm on a road trip up the west coast &amp; I just watched my first San Fran improv show and was FLOORED. I noticed that most LA improv is obsessed with finding the game and exploiting it (1,2,3 times then move on) whereas San Francisco improv is more about really becoming the character and building the relationships. Way deeper, richer, and smarter imo. (Also the improv scene in LA is swamped with dramatic actors looking for improv on their resume... And my improv team members -- as is the case it seems with a lot of teams in LA -- didn't want to bond or hang out or anything like that, so I wouldn't see them unless for practice or a show.)


Anyway this is semi-relevant because I am about to move to Chicago, one of the main reasons being the improv there, but I don't know the scene at all.

Can anyone try to summarize how Chicago improv feels/ the philosophy at its core? How is it compared to LA or San Fran or any other big city?

So, I started my Improv journey in March by joining a 101 class. (and I just started 201). I've also been to quite a few jams, as well as auditions.

I do get laughs and complements, but I also reside in an extremely supportive environment, so I doubt their sincerity. I also feel that all the laughs that I get during the jams were either blind luck or low hanging fruit.

I'm constantly worried that I shouldn't be here, or that the next show, I won't be as lucky and it will be a mess. Worst of all, I'm afraid I'm not growing and I'll never be good enough to be in a troup.

2. Two penises. 

Rhyming exercise. 

Group chants ""two penises. Two penises. What would you do with two penises?""

Then someone comes up with a rhyme based on one penis I would ______ the other penis I would ________.

The group repeats the chant, then the next person goes. 

3. I am. I am. We are. 

Two-prov exercise. Two players get a variable, then come up with characters and situation based on that variable. 

Variable: baseball. 

Person one: I am a baseball player. 

Person two: I am a baseball coach. 

Person one: we are working on my swing. 

Then they do the scene. 

4. 2nd Date at TGI Fridays. 

Two characters have a second date at a TGIFridays. They know each other, they like each other.

6. Stretch and Share. 

Every person in the group picks a stretch, which the group copies. Then the person tells a funny thing that happened since before the group met. 

7. 7 things. 

Given a variable, a person must come up with seven things. 

Example. Football teams. 

1. Falcons. 2. Redskins. Etc. etc.

i wanted to see if anyone on r/improv has struggled with and followed through on moving to a new city. why not just move to LA (or whatever your goal city is) and start there? there are so many performers from NY and chicago already teaching in LA that you'll be learning many different philosophies anyway. it just seems to me another case of being loyal to a theater instead of looking out for yourself. or am i missing something important? is anyone really judging anyone else if they don't ""put in enough time"" in a certain city or theater?","theater loyalty and ""putting in your time"""

improv,"hi everyone, I was at rehearsal today and there was something I find I have issues with.

so we were doing an exercise where one player does object work while the other gives verbal offer. the object work cannot be dismissed and must have some significance in the scene. the pkayer doing object work must more or less keep doing whatever activity they are doing without making the scene about the activity.

this is great because we are avoiding inventing or complicating things. instead we are jist working with minimal stuff.

the thing is, I guess only practice will make this better, but I find object work super distracting. when I was the person who was not doing object work, I found I was able to connect to my partner or make the scene forward.

my coach mentioned to commit to an emotion or react to what my partner is saying which does help, but the issue is often im too focused on the object work and activity to give honest reactions to my partner.

I really cant think of anything other than practice makes perfect, so if there are any other tips to do, id appreciate it.

I'm a noob and am just finishing a Level 1 couse at Toronto's Bad Dog Theater. I also started a Level A course at Second City Toronto because it's closer to home and they make you start at A so you're using their preferred method. 

Now I find that I like Bad Dog better, (SC feels a bit pretentious) but the Bad Dog feels like it might have limitations in growth compared to SC beyond beginner classes.

improv,"The team that I'm on has recently lost our regular coach. We have been rotating through many different options and are still deciding who we want to stick with. At our last practice we had a new coach that I wasn't that into. In my experience, a typical coach zeroes in on a particular skill to work on, takes you through some exercises to strengthen that one skill, then you do some sets. By the end of practice, everyone is feeling confident, and positive that the final set was the best/most polished. 

This is not what our last coach did. This coach gave very aimless and negative though valid notes throughout, but without any real solution to get us on the right track. When it came to our final set of the night, before we got to a crescendo, the coach stopped us mid-action and said something like ""are you guys planning on bringing everything together? There are only a few minutes left in the set. All the characters and events should become intertwined by the end."" This was not necessary as we were already on our way there, and the wind was taken out of our sails. Then instead of letting us do this big crescendo to our set, the coach said ""I don't need to see that, lets just get to the notes."" The whole practice left me feeling unsatisfied, and our team agrees not to bring this coach in again, but it left me wondering. Was this truly a bad coach or did we just not like the negative feedback? You don't want to feel like you're rejecting something just because it is maybe challenging you. Do coaches owe it to the teams they coach to make practice fun? Or is giving strong but productive criticism more important?",Does practice need to be fun?
improv,"These two guys do a show in New York called The Cheep Show. Musical improv, stand up comedy, and long form improv scenes. I found them through this subreddit and after watching one of their videos I reached out to them and invited them to come down to Palm Beach Florida for some sun. 

A partial lie, because I locked them in a theater all weekend and forced them to train students. They got some beach, but they have delicate skin and I can't have them burned!

They were two of the most professional, knowledgeable, and talented young men I have ever worked with. At just 25 years old they really impressed me with how well they got great work out of every student.

improv,"Hi there /r/improv!

I've created a website that aims to help improv/comedy minded people to exercise their comedic ability and get a better understanding about how well their jokes score. You can visit the site on [jokejudger.com](http://jokejudger.com).

A little introduction: I'm a student with a great passion for improv and currently researching computational humour (which is about how to generate humour with computers). For this research, I need quite some data, and thus I've created an online application called [JokeJudger](http://jokejudger.com). This application allows people to anonymously create jokes with challenges like in real improv and smart suggestions if necessary. Later, the website will show them the *(also anonymous)* ratings they've received for each joke using nice little graphs of the received scores.
This should allow people to get an honest view on how well their jokes score, without any of the classical biases we get on stage.

Currently, the joke form is limited to jokes in the form of ""I like my X like I like my Y, Z"", as this is a nice classic improv game, and should reduce the ""blank page syndrom"".

I hope you guys enjoy this site! I'd love to hear your feedback to make this application even better!

For instance, I was in a scene where I was playing a a kid who was insanely slow and deliberate as he filled his luggage. My instructor side-coached me with ""Why does your character do this?"" I had to go into invention mode instead of discovery mode. I landed on ""One time my mom and dad went on a trip, and my mom didn't come back because she was always so scatterbrained.""

improv,"Hi

I'm DM-ing a Fate Core game. The rules are meant for collaborative play, meaning that the players can -- and are meant to -- have a say in background info and how some of the action goes. Ideally it should go like directed improv with me as the GM providing the backbone of the Story, the less the cooler.

Problem is, I may have underestimated how hard this would be for non-improvisers. We've been going through character creation and I've been noticing my players having great difficulty to commit to ideas and going with the flow, yes-anding and so on. They're easily paralyzed with choice, trying to get everything ""perfect"".

I don't want to scare them with physical exercises or scene work, so here's the question: 

What are some good exercises to get my players to let go of trying to perfectly nail down everything up front and make them less afraid of making up stuff as it comes up, just going with their first impulse? Maybe also playing characters that aren't what they started out thinking they were. 

As I said, preferrably verbal exercises because I don't want to overwhelm them, but I'm grateful for all ideas.

improv,"Hey Improvisers,

I'm a novice improviser with 18 weeks of classes at a local theater that trains under the Annoyance style. We had our first showcase last night in front of a crowd that paid to see a comedysportz match--we did a montage long form show for 8 min right before intermission.

I went into the performance feeling weirdly relaxed. I felt like I knew what I had to do: establish a POV, connect a relationship with my scene partner, interact with the environment, heighten. All of that somewhat went out the window when we got our suggestion and fear of the audience's expectations set in.

The first scene I was in, we established that we were graduating seniors in a locker room after our last big match of the season. I established myself as a now aimless jock. My personal game was football was the only thing I was good at and now I would be disappointed with only being average. My scene partner and I kind of floundered around talking about how terrible we were at odd jobs and our football career being over. Then, My scene partner offered that he was in love with me and he fully committed to a confessional with tears and everything. I panicked. Another teammate third-ed in as the coach delivered a line about finding us jobs and the scene was cut. The audience's response was pretty cold throughout the scene. We had a few chortles when we talked about how badly our character's lives outside of football were and it became dead silent after the confessional.

The move wasn't totally unexpected--we had been playing around with being in love with each other during practice, but someone was usually playing a girl character. I'm also actually gay, but the character I had in my head was straight. The only thing I could think about in the moment was what would the audience think/want and I feared that was in conflict with what I would want as a person and how my character would respond. So, I just bailed.

In hindsight, I could have had some fun plays off of the gift like discovering that he had been leaving love notes in my locker, or realizing I'd been touching his butt during games for the last four years, ect. Instead, fear won and I just wanted off stage.

The rest of the show went okay. I didn't make any big choices after that scene, but I was able to support and set up some good scenes. At the after party, we got a positive response from our coach and some of the other improvisers in the professional troupe.

The general guidance I've gleaned from improv blogs is that failing is part of the process and you just need to keep getting back up. Should I talk to my team about what happened or is it more of a personal insecurity I need to deal with? There's a decent probability we will be together for another 8 wk class and showcase.

Do you consider audience reactions at all when improvising long form? Or, do you double down on committing to your choice regardless?

My partner and I just had our first twoprov practice with a coach, and our most consistent feedback was that we need to get to the unusual thing faster and heighten more. Our scenes were grounded and top-of-intelligence, maybe too much so--it took a lot of slow building to get to something unusual. 

I struggle with the balance between wanting to be grounded and wanting to get funnier--I can see that our scenes are moving too slowly but I feel reluctant to force a big character choice. 

I'm also wondering if part of the problem is our opening--we've done organic openings and also a deconstruction, and I've always had a much easier time with premise-based like a monologue or even pattern game. With those, I can walk into the scene with an unusual thing in mind and try to create a character around that, instead of starting with a character and trying to come up with an unusual thing. 

This is a little unfocused, but I'm curious to hear if any of you have struggled with something similar or found any warmups/exercises that helped with this kind of thing. ",getting to the unusual thing faster

The Reason For The Excitement:
I know for some improvisers, DCM might not be a big deal to get into, but for a college student from Ohio, this is a big deal. What makes it even more exciting for me is that I go to a large school that has two fairly good improv teams, and I had gotten rejected from both teams four times after having tried out each semester. After all the rejection, I joined our schools humor magazine and decided that I would never be good at improv. After starting a sketch comedy group with the people in the magazine, some of us decided to try and make an improv team, with the goal being performing at DCM. After a month of intense training consisting of 40 minute disasters of long forms and no idea how you train for improv, we did a performance for our friends  and sent that footage out, feeling that there was no way a mediocre team from Ohio would make the cut. 

The reason I thank the subreddit is because after each rejection, I would not even want to think about improv. But, everyday I would look at Reddit, and I would see a post from r/improv. Sometimes they would just be random theatre questions, but sometimes they would be improvisers doubting themselves.

Have around 6 months of improv experience, played in 10-13 shows. 
Couple of weeks ago I (by absolute chance) did improvised stand-up, 10 minute set.  Have never done anything like it before, showed up to see the show, friend asked to replace last minute flake and I gave it a go.
It was very low stakes, because even if I failed, nobody (including me) expected anything. I had no experience and wasn't even familiar with the format of the show.  


That's why I had a lot of fun. The problem that it went really well. I had some offers to do it again, more seriously, but now I am scared shitless. 
I feel like my first time was just blind luck and I simply can't top the jokes that i came up at that moment. The stakes are much higher now, some people ask me to perform, others tell how good and funny I was and literally pushing me to do it again.


I am seriously, honestly afraid of failing miserably, more then I ever been before. Even  at my second show in my life, when 12 performers out of 16 bailed, and 4 of us had to go on for 50 minutes instead of 10, I was scared to my bones but still not as much.

* when he is talking, some of the other team members or myself might comment or say something, but he is not at all listening to offers

* if we let him finish talking, then reply, then he will continue talking non stop after in responsr to our response.

* he also doesnt hear offers from members who are on sidelines or minor and supporting characters within his scene.

I understand that people can also say/do things during yes-anding that they don't realize are unusual, and that can then be framed by the other player to be the first unusual thing, which would clearly be an example of one type of finding a FUT and not forcing it.

Some years ago during a troupe rehearsal there was a scene where I chose to be a duck. I thought it was fine, but after the scene our director told me not to be an animal again because according to her ""animals aren't characters and watching someone squawk isn't interesting."" 


I left the troupe mainly for other reasons, but this particular incident has left me hesitant about trying improv again. In my opinion humans are animals, and other animals are as complex as humans, so there's no reason why communication with them can't be as engaging. I recall not speaking with words, exactly, but I did do varied vocalizations and movements and facial expressions, and my scene partner, who played a human, had no trouble playing off of me. 


I feel like I was told not to act a particular age, or gender, or profession, or ethnicity, or emotion, just because a particular age, or gender, or profession, or ethnicity, or emotion isn't interesting, which is of course untrue. Are werewolves also not okay? What about ghosts? What about robots? What about some random mythical creature invented on the spot? I get that sometimes people may continuously fall back on a stereotyped role because they're afraid to venture into something new, but it was the first and only time, as far as I recall, in several weeks of being in that group, that I was a non-human. I am reluctant now to return to improv, even though I really miss it, because it seems to me that a healthy aspect of my spontaneity is, well, not allowed. Like I have to keep some kind of arbitrary rule in my head not to do something. I can accept rules if they make sense to me but this one doesn't.

improv,"I just thought of a different way I'd like to approach game and it's making me curious about what everyone else thinks.  I'd like to hear other ideas about how you find a funny idea in a scene and how you continue to keep the scene funny to an audience. 

This is based on my own experience and may not be true for everyone.  Sorry in advanced for my writing's rabbit-hole tendencies.

When I first heard of the concept of ""letting go of your own ideas on stage,"" I thought it equivocated to ""don't be a bully.""  Although listening and acknowledging your partner's ideas is vital to a scene, I don't believe those tips fully encapsulate ""letting go of your own ideas.""  

When you let go of your own ideas, you open yourself up to the unintentional and the accidental.  It's the moment when there's a slight miscommunication or an accidental justification that you find funny when you need to let go of everything you thought the scene was about prior.  It doesn't matter if you haven't done the monologue justice yet. If you've already found something funny, don't try to add the old premise in, you already have the fun right in front of you.  

I like to propose an alternative to the term ""playing game.  Rather, I think of it as ""giving in to the game.""  Most of the people on stage *know* when something is funny or not.  You pull a student aside after a scene that went blue and you ask them if they thought the scene was funny, and they'll likely say no.  Ask them if they thought the scene was funny *while they were in it* and they will still say no.  The game and the funny is there no matter what because it's the relationship between the improvisers that makes me laugh. If you and your partner both give in to the game, you'll come out feeling better than if you both are focused on playing the game.

I have always wanted to try and learn some comedy pointers, so this year after leaving a job that kept me from voicing any opinions in a public forum, I decided to test the water a bit.

I learn something new every time like timing, beats, stage confidence and most importantly ignoring the bombs and moving on immediately.  

Recently I joined a stand up workshop, started working on a 5 min set and hitting a mic.  That has been scary and great at the same time. Scary because at mics, nobody laughs because they are all there to work on their stuff, so it is kind of a competition environment I guess.

what are some formats that incorporate narrative? we are not a narrative based team, but I would like to suggest some of these for our team.

any format that gives room for story development and character development is great. just no more harold. I think we have had enough :)

to give an idea, there was a format I saw where there is a panel of filmmalers who pitch an idea for a film, then act out certain scenes in front of producers, who then will give edits for the filmamkers to improve. the filmmakers will act oit scenes again with changes.

From IRC Wiki:
""The Slacker is a longform improvised form built around the use of tag-outs to transition to new scenes. It is similar to a La Ronde, but with no restrictions with regard to the order of tag outs or the number of characters one might play. The form has been attributed to the team Beer Shark Mice.""

improv,"Just to provide some context.

I'm from Australia and I've been taking improv classes for the past 8 weeks in a level 1 class. I just performed my first improv showcase last night and I left a little disappointed.

Now, I probably wasn't that bad, but I think I could have done a lot better and I do usually set unnecessary high standards for myself.

So, I think the biggest reason I didn't perform as well as I could have was nerves. I've never performed in my life, and I was definitely feeling nervous before and during the showcase. I was also disappointed because I felt like the past few weeks before the showcase, I was really satisfied with how well I was going during the classes. And the reason for that was because after 5 classes (5 weeks), I started to loosen up, relax, be comfortable around my classmates, not panic (so much) in practice scenes or even in a ""yes and"" game and just started to have fun with it.

So my question is, how can I fast track myself to that feeling of relaxation on stage (and even in classes)? Of course it will come after experience, the more I practice and do classes and shows, but is there anymore I can do?

I've also passed level 1 and doing level 2 this week, and I think I will also go through the usual routine of panic and anxiety, because I will be in a class full of people I do not know. So I don't want to have to wait until week 5 of 8 until I start feeling comfortable. I want that as soon as I can.

Lots of ""do you want to..."" and ""maybe we could..."" and ""yeah, and we could also..."", but it never seems to switch from yes-and to if-then. So, often, the result is just a dramatically muddy pile of emotionally unconnected random absurdities stacked on top of each other that don't add up to anything.

Example: the get is ""wildfire"", so someone initiates as a trainer warning an athlete not to keep overdoing it if he wants to avoid that burning sensation in his muscles. ""Yes, but I just had to bring that weightlifing machine with me while I was riding on horseback..."",AND THEN a few lines later, he's getting married to the horse, AND THEN he's paralyzed from the neck down, AND THEN he's committing assisted suicide etc.

improv,"(skip to '***' for the abridged version)

Let me be clear. Improv fucks with me like nothing else that I do.

I have lived the last 10 years of my life in a self-critical bubble of negativity and low self-esteem. There is no way in hell I could have seen myself doing improv 1.5 years ago.

At that point, I picked up improv for just one purpose: to be comfortable in my own skin.
     To me, improv was a place to practice that. Improv was to get me out of my shell. Improv was the means to self-confidence.

I am in college and I am on two improv teams (15 members each) - both with different styles. One of my teams draws crowds of up to 100 every week, and most people would assume that I'm a star player. However, I just keep getting stuck in my head all the time. I compare myself to other players on my teams and I get self-conscious, wondering why I can't do what they do (think quickly and creatively with confidence).
     Every time I go to practice or a show, I have to take a minute to prepare myself. I try to be loose, confident, and talkative. I'm not that way, but I want to be. I TRY. I sometimes am successful, but most of the time, I am not who I want to be.
     Every time I feel dissapointed about a practice or a performance, I try to reassure myself that this is a process. I want to be who I truly am, but I'm stuck in my shell still. Sometimes I come out, most of the time I don't. That is why improv has been a challenge for me.

***Anyway, that's the emotional garbage I've got for you. But let's talk strategies.

My major problems:
1) low confidence
2) slow cognition
3) lack of creativity

My solutions, respectively:
1)
-attack the stage, trust yourself and your team, be a little reckless.
-open up to my teammates about the challenges I face.
-tell my negative self-talk to shut up.
2)
-read some books. I haven't finished an entire book in 4 years. Instead I read academic jargon for school.
-Maybe do a 15 minute freewrite before practice to get my brain in gear.
-keep up with meditation regularly. I've been trying, but I'm not consistent
-get sleep, eat healthy, and exercise (try to get endorphins before improv)
3)
-Do some creative writing. I have never done that ever. One of my ideas is to just write down everything new that I learn and somehow incorporate that into a creative writing piece.

I already know what I need to do. I need to attack the stage. I need to HAVE FUN. I need to relax. I need to be vulnerable. I need to think positively.

If I let myself react emotionally to what is happening in the scene, I can stay present and react to things organically, but I miss a lot of stuff that could be used to heighten the scene and I forget information that I and my scene partner said. Essentially I miss the stuff that makes the difference between a scene between two people, and a show with a theme that repeats (the latter of which, I go nuts for.)

When I hear things that spark the ""aha! I know what's happening here"" feeling I can play them but it feels stilted and the audience lets me know that it's funny enough for some trepidatious laughs, but not enough to really make them care about what they're watching.

improv,"Here is my dissertation on why Objection is a superior game, what a good run of Objection looks like in a shortform show, and what it can teach an improviser.

But first, introductions. Hey! I do amateur improv in Nottingham, England, generally shortform and games. I like taking games apart and figuring out why they're helpful, and what makes a 'good' run of a particular game. I'm sure ""Why I Like the Game ___"" will be a popular and long-running series of posts.

### Objection

Objection as defined by my uni group is a game where 6 players get into 2 teams with the goal of recounting something to a judge. Often we take a task from the audience and the teams recount that. One team will be performing at once, and the other team watches them for either internal inconsistencies or things that don't make sense. When this happens the player who noticed it will say objection, and explain the contradiction to the judge. If sustained, that team will take over the telling of the tale.

For me, when this game is well-played it *looks* competitive. At first the teams have quite reasonable objections. ""He's walked right over the hole he dug!"" Then as the scene goes on, the stakes are raised by having more frequent, pettier objections.  ""Objection! He's wearing glasses! Objection! I was standing further to the left!"" Great stuff.

### What it trains

For new improvisers this game trains you not to deny the base reality of a scene, but as a more experienced improviser it has turned into a far more collaborative affair. This game doesn't look like it's emphasising collaboration, but just last week I found myself intentionally contradicting what I'd said so the other team could pick up on it. The team not performing is in charge of all the punchlines, so the team on stage is in charge of setting them up. So when you no longer accidentally mess up so often, you have to purposefully mess up.

It also trains listening. The players not performing are actively listening for something to call attention to, which is a vital collaborative skill. In the context of this game, contradicting a scene partner constitutes building on their idea. The improviser who listens for something, finds it, and makes a joke about it feels pretty good because they advanced the scene and looked like they got one over on the other team. The game is structured such that active listening is rewarded.

So to close, Objection is a great way to teach improvisers that they're in this together, even when they're on opposite teams.",Why I Like the Game Objection

I am around two years in to improv and just having fun. I tried out and made it on to a “house team” for a theater/school in a decent sized city (yea!). I was thinking it meant regular rehearsals and performances for about four months (two solid of practices followed by two of practices and performances). It has turned into rehearsals for a few months, when the coach can make it, and one show a month, with a commitment in the nine-month open-ended may-go-sooner-or-longer range. Is this as ad hoc as it sounds?

Sure, groups often do a warm-up together, but is there anything that you do personally, as an individual, to prepare yourself mentally or physically for performance?

I myself do not have a routine other than to stretch out my face a little bit. I don't necessarily make silly faces for the duration of my performance, but I find that stretching my facial muscles helps me to prepare: I open my eyes as wide as I can and squint them hard, and I stretch my jaw and lips to their extremities. With the eyes, I feel it helps my facial expression. With the mouth, I feel it helps my enunciation as well as facial expression.

Sometimes I listen to music to psych myself out a little bit, but not always. I do find that a little time alone helps me to perform, even though I am part of an ensemble.

improv,"I've been doing improv since 2012. If you take away the short breaks I've had, I've been doing improv for a little more than 4 years now. Most of it long-form. I've just started doing some coaching and I want to start teaching classes at my current theater. I am very passionate about teaching and coaching improv.

Recently, an opportunity came up where I might be able to move to Chicago. This last summer I did the 5 week intensive at iO and really enjoyed it. I loved Chicago and the improv there was incredibly inspiring. The experience truly changed the way I play and approach improv.

However, this would be the third time I've moved cities and had to start over at a new theater. Its frustrating because I know if I make the move (especially to Chicago), I won't teach or coach for quite some time even though I think I have the experience necessary to at the very least coach. I'd love going through classes again but am worried that since I'm starting over I may not be able to have the almost weekly performing opportunities I do now. And while I most certainly believe that you can always learn more, I definitely think at this point I'd prefer to have more shows over even more classes.

I will say that I think my end-game goal is to eventually open up my own theater (most likely NOT in Chicago). Having extensive training and experience in Chicago improv would be an awesome credential to have. Obviously, this is a long term kind of goal. Maybe 5-10 years out.

I'm just kind of torn. And I don't really know what the right move is. Most people I hear that move to Chicago do it when they are about 1-2 years deep into improv. And I'm at least double that in experience. It also seems like a lot of people move away from Chicago to LA or something once they get some experience to try to find acting work. That's not a big deal to me because while I'd love to be a working actor, I'm definitely more passionate towards the art of improv itself. While I wouldn't hesitate to accept an offer to be on SNL its not really a 'goal' of mine and I'm more interested in just getting better and making improv BIGGER.

I have been performing long form improv in a small city (Dayton, OH) for about a year now (I realize this is basically no experience in the grand scheme of performing) and my buddy and I would like to make a leap and move to one of the bigger cities to pursue a career in comedy (improv classes, sketch writing, actor, sitcom writing, standup, etc). My question has mainly to do with the cities I am considering. New York seems to be a favorite as well as Chicago and I know a lot of the positives of moving to either one. For reasons I won’t get into, there are a few small factors (independent of improv and comedy) that lean towards choosing Atlanta. 

Does anyone perform in Atlanta and/or can anyone speak to the city’s improv and comedy scene in general? I have heard a few things about it being an up and coming city for the film industry specifically and through searches I’ve found there to be a handful of improv theaters as well. I get that New York, Chicago, LA would be the ideal places but I somewhat wonder about any saturation of performers pursuing these careers there and wonder if you could stand out more in a city like Atlanta. That is, only if there is a good amount of comedy, film and otherwise, happening there.

improv,"We are a group of relatively new performers, all over 50, with less than 2 years experience in improv. We got together last summer with 8 members. We wanted to be a Harold troupe, and started working towards that goal in our weekly practices. After a couple of confusing, frustrating rehearsals, and some weak performances, we shit-canned the Harold and simply went to doing a montage of scenes.

One of the things we liked about the Harold was the way it opened: with an invocation, or a word association - something totally different than just getting an audience suggestion and going from that suggestion only.

So our show is now a montage, with a single monologue opening - one of our members will step forward and do a 2-3 minute monologue based on an audience suggestion. The monologue gives us lots to work with for our show. Since this is still relatively new to us, sometimes the way the monologue starts is kind of clumsy - we'll all check in with each other to make sure we're not stepping on toes before just jumping up front. (we've been told that we're 'too polite')

We switched to a new coach in November. The new coach and her husband are well respected in our community, are in several troupes, tight with the owners and staff, and have a long history there. They compliment each other as coaches, in that if one can't make rehearsal, the other one can, and they share notes. They have slightly different coaching styles, but one is not better or worse than the other. 

Cut to rehearsal yesterday: this is our first rehearsal with our new coach in 3 weeks (both she and husband were away, so we had a sub for the last two weeks).

We had an effective 1-1/2 hours of rehearsal, exercises, etc. Near the end, as she was summarizing, we asked us how we felt about our show overall. We all agreed that we need work, but we're comfortable with the way things are going.

She then began to tell us how poor the monologue opening is for us, and how a poor monologue will lead to a poor show. We should immediately TRASH the monologue, not work on it anymore, and do something else. 

** NOTE ** she or her husband have never ever SEEN our show, nor have we done a full run with a monologue in rehearsals. They've only seen notes from others. 

We told her that we wanted to keep the monologue, and work on it. She wouldn't have it, and in the end, the discussion became kind of heated. One of our members left the room to cool off and not say something he'd regret. She took that as ""disrespectful"" and in the end, quit the troupe. 

This discussion all went downhill very quickly, and none of us could figure out what the hell had just happened. We decided to give it a day, and then approach her to come back.

She quit again via instant messenger before we could do that, affirming her decision.

So are we wrong to want to fix this? We don't want to have a reputation in our community as being argumentative. We don't want other coaches to avoid us, and still want to get booked and get shows. But but we also want to do a show that we want to do. 

Is it unreasonable to ask for A and expect A and not B?

improv,"Hi all,
I have been on a college improv, sketch, and stand-up group for three years now. But I want to try something new in an over-shadowed city. I want to try to create an improv // comedy space. Yeah. That's a lofty goal... right?

But the real question I have is how about making it happen. Most of you who may comment will probably say for me to get experience in a well-established improv comedy theatre. But, my budding idealistic millennial mind says ""I want to do it now"".

Obviously I have to start small -- maybe find a bar that allows comedy shows and try to do a weekly/monthly shows. I have the connections to make that happen. But my goal includes a performance space, and classes for the public. I am not looking to turn a profit. Any thoughts? Build me up and/or tear me apart.

improv,"Hey guys. I am going to be taking the iO 5 week summer intensive in Chicago and had some questions that I thought you may be able to answer. My primary concern is with housing while staying in Chicago. I am planning on using AirBnB, but am still worried about safety. A lot of what I have read online seems to say that as long as you are north of downtown you should be fine, but I was wondering if anyone here had any specific locations they would suggest. To that note, if there is anyone else taking the classes and is also looking for a place to stay and wants to potentially live together, let me know! I'm a 20 year old guy studying in Florida. 

I was also just kind of wondering what to expect from the class. Almost all of my experience with learning improv is at a college level, although I have watched a lot online.

improv,"A few posts recently have popped up about the importance of Who, What, Where being communicated in the first three lines. Naturally, people have popped up (myself included) to say it's not important. To elaborate: from my point of view, there are more important and more useful things to focus on in the first few lines. 

I feel like there's a disconnect here on what that means. Certainly, we all agree *specifics* are important—it's not a good idea to have vague people doing nothing in Limboland. But at the same time, the instruction sounds as though it's divorced from the rest of the scene—as if to robotically say ""We have established the information, now we may commence with the scene.""

I also feel the three-line-rule to be artificial and panic-inducing. Who cares if I called you ""Dad"" or said ""Home Depot"" at the *fifth* line? At the same time, there are diminishing returns if you withhold from labeling things far into a scene. How can we reconcile this into something more productive?

So at this point, what do people who want to do improv as a hobby do? I think since my last 401 class was in Summer 2014 I can't even take 401 again. I would not be willing to start at 101 again at UCB.

improv,"I just got kicked out of my improv group earlier today. 

The reasons for it is that there is a disconnect between myself and the group--with style, scheduling, etc. But also with group members being absolutely uncomfortable with me. 

Long story short, I have depression. As of writing this, I am doing fine. The last time I had a relapse was back in the summer time. The last couple of shows we had, I kept beating myself up. None of them really helped me out or asked if I was okay. And with our last show, in early DEC, I felt awesome! We really clicked.

But along the way, depression got the best of me. I was in bad moods, said some stupid stuff, emotional, being burnt out...there is a lot to unpack. I have no problem with addressing it if anyone was curious. But at this given moment, I've never felt better about myself. There were bumps along the way, but I am feeling good!

I found out today through an email that the group decided to kick me out. This was a little bit of a shock, especially on how it was written, but I also wasn't that surprised. The disconnect and the groups uncomfortable feelings for me really killed it. I recognized it awhile ago, but I never had time to acknowledge it because of school/work/other shows.

I wrote all of them back an email saying how disappointed I am and wished that we could've talked this out, but explained that this was the right call. Along with apologizes for the things that I did unintentionally, I said it was an honor to share the stage and wished them the best of luck.

I want to know, if this has happen to anyone, how do you deal with being kicked out of the group? What is the best advice? Its something that I don't think is talked about often, but I'd love to know what you think.

EDIT: When I meant by being ""burnt out"", I was doing A LOT. I was working in the mornings, going to school, acting in shows...I was pulling 12-14 hour days and I would cap it off with improv rehearsals. Thus making me really tired/cranky and the complete opposite of who I am. That isn't depression, it is just being exhausted as balls.  ",Getting Kicked Out of an Improv Group

improv,"I love improv.

I believe the first three lines are the most important part of an improv show.  My favorite exercise, one I employ before every show, is where everyone on the troupe cycles through two-person, three-line scenes to get one quick refresher on the fundamentals before we go on stage.  

Here’s what I look for in a three-line scene:

The first line is the initiation, where the actor with an idea gives the idea to the team.

 In the second line, an improviser responds, indicating they heard the reality, they agree, and then adds something to the reality.  

The third line accepts the addition to the reality, then builds off of it.  

In this essay, I’m going to break down a very successful scene’s first three lines to show how two expert improvisers use the beginning of this scene to set the tone for a whole show, and why this first interaction is so important.  This is intended to help someone with no background in improvisation get a glimpse “behind the scene,” and give an idea of how an improviser thinks when they’re creating. 

Before I get to that, I want to quickly say I don’t think there’s a single recipe for good improv.  Take everything with a grain of salt.  I’ve seen amazing improv that breaks all the “rules.”  I’ve seen tepid, boring improv that did everything an improv team is supposed to do.  However, I think that all good improv has some characteristics in common:  collaboration, playfulness, commitment, and CROWS.  CROWS is an anagram I was taught that stands for Character, Relationship, Objective, Where, and Story. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ_B_oxh3lY

This is the best improv scene I’ve seen on YouTube.  It’s by a team called Fuck That Shit.  I love this scene, and want to explain why I love this scene.

Fuck That Shit’s work always involves strong CROWS and an insane degree of commitment to the reality of their scenes.  You can tell from watching them that they are just having a ball on stage, and the audience soaks that in.  

Also, I never see them argue or stump each other, which is a pet peeve I have.  I think when people pay to see an improv team they pay to watch strangers work together, not point out each others mistakes for cheap laughs.

Now to the scene itself.  They get the variable “Wiccan.”  This show starts in a two-person scene, which is something I advocate because the lack of additional players allows the two performers to focus completely on setting the reality they are playing on.  

The first line of this scene by Fuck That Shit is the best initiation I’ve ever heard.

AARON JACKSON:  Okay, this is going to be a real séance this time, okay?  None of your bullshit.

There’s a lot of great things going into this initiation.  He took the variable, internalized it, and turned it into an idea.  We know that this guy is trying to contact the dead, and we know that he’s tried to do this before, but was spoiled by some “bullshit” from the other person in this scene.  So, in two sentences, Jackson established three of the elements from CROWS.  
**   Character.  Jackson established his character is someone who believes it’s possible to contact the dead.   

*  Relationship.  He is in the scene with another believer who spoiled the last attempt. 
*  Objective.  We know the characters are trying to hold a séance.  

Now let’s look at the second line.

KATE ZELENSKY:  Janice, the last time I went into diabetic shock.

Kate is doing everything you want your scene partner to do.  She listened, accepted, and built. There’s a lot of great work going into this line.

1.	She named Aaron’s character “Janice.”  This further establishes the relationship between Kate’s character and Aaron’s.

2.	Look how she focused on what her partner was saying, and asked herself, “what could he possibly be referring to?”  But instead of asking Aaron to clarify, she does the work and answers the question for him, supplying a backstory.  She explained the “bullshit” brought up by Janice.  In two lines, we already have an idea of the backstory between these two characters.  Backstory is very important in improv.  It’s hard to make compelling scenes between characters who are meeting for the first time.  By giving these characters a history together, the relationship is strengthened, and we are starting to have a story.

3.	She raised the stakes.  By saying that she went into diabetic shock, she tells the audience that this séance is very important to the two characters, so important that they would try again even after one of them almost died.  

Moving on to the third line,

AARON JACKSON:  Yeah, you fucking lesbo.  Can we have a real séance?  My grand mother died in this house.  I killed her.  So let’s call her up!

* 	It starts with an agreement, and then raises the stakes by committing to an emotional reaction, then adds new information.
* 	Character.  We add new information with the word “lesbo.”  We’ve established that Janice is a bully and a control freak who is fixated on lesbianism.  This strengthens the character and clarifies the relationship.
* 	Story. We now know who the séance is intended to contact, and the idea of murdering someone and then trying to contact their spirit is just so stupid it’s brilliant.  
* 	Where.  We know we’re in a house where a grandmother was recently murdered.

In three lines, these two actors created a rich reality starring two characters who share a complex relationship and back story.  They did it by agreeing with each others ideas and building off of them.  The result is something wholly original.

It’s important to note the physicality that these two are utilizing, very loose, youthful energy, and using voices that indicate they are playing characters younger than the actors are. This, combined with the immature language, sets up a scene where these bitchy, cliquey high school students are trying to contact Janice’s lesbian grand-mother.

This is the golden standard when you’re starting a show.  This isn’t a good opener because it’s funny, it’s a good opener because it establishes a rich reality with characters who have a clear relationship and objective that the scene can grow from.  

This is why I love improv.  On the surface, improv looks like people being silly, having fun, fooling around.  And to a large part it is.  But there’s also a lot of learning and practice that is required before you can get to the level that this team is at, where you can have so much fun on stage while still crafting compelling scenes.  It’s much harder than it looks, and Fuck That Shit makes it look easy.",How to Start a Scene with Fuck That Shit

improv,"[Katie Rich of ‘S.N.L.’ Is Suspended for Tweet Mocking Barron Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/arts/television/katie-rich-snl-suspended-barron-trump-tweet.html)

The Tweet in question: ""Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter.""

There's a lot to unpack here:

1) It was her personal Twitter account, not an SNL affiliated-account

2) Was the joke in poor taste? IMHO yes, because the children of the President have been traditionally off-limits. However, comedy is about testing the boundaries and sometimes you cross it.
 
*(To be clear: I am anti-Barron jokes. Unlike the other Trump children, as a 10-year old he did not decide to spotlight himself in the public/political life)*

3) The only analogous situation from SNL's history really isn't (from wikipedia)--

&gt;In a December 5, 1992 ""Wayne's World"" sketch, the characters Wayne and Garth (portrayed by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey, respectively) made fun of Chelsea Clinton (daughter of the then President-elect Bill Clinton). Wayne noted that while ""adolescence has been thus far unkind"" to the then-12 year old, Garth opined that ""she could turn into a babe in waiting."" First Lady Hillary Clinton was publicly critical of the jokes and they were subsequently edited out of all repeats and syndication rebroadcasts of this sketch. ""We felt, upon reflection, that if it was in any way hurtful, it wasn't worth it,"" said executive producer Lorne Michaels. ""She's a kid, a kid who didn't choose to be in public life."" Myers even wrote an apology letter to the White House.

That bit appeared on-air on an SNL episode, which means at some point Lorne signed off on it. As far as I can tell, no one was suspended.

4) While racist/ignorant public officials have been taken to task for online comments, a public official should be held to a higher standard than a private citizen. However, we have seen examples where incendiary comments online have cost a private citizen their job. What effect will this have on other comedy writers on mainstream shows who maintain an active social media presence?

5) Some comedians are starting a [#keepkatierich hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23keepkatierich&amp;src=tyah) on Facebook and Twitter.

In short form it seems a bit easier to deal with them, since short form is speaking to the audience directly more often than in long form.

I have been doing improv for about five years. I have done roughly 80-100 shows, founded my own Improv group in my small Atlantic Canadian City, am mostly self-learned (UCB Comedy Improv Manual, Impro, a couple Del Close books, etc.), and have mostly worked with atleast three other people.

After saving up money over the last few years I’ve made the leap to Toronto. I am planning on trying out for the second city conservatory and taking tons of workshops and classes.

I’m currently compiling a master list of online resources, articles, blogs, podcasts, and videos about learning more. I’m not looking for just comedy podcasts, but rather learning resources.

So please give me all your links and resources!

This month we're launching an exciting new contest that I'd like to tell you about...

contest4improv4humans is a nationwide improv competition that will take place at participating comedy theaters across the US. Teams of 3-4 improvisers will sign up for a slot on a live show at one of these theaters; each team will be videotaped, doing their best 20 minute set in the style of improv4humans. That is, like a podcast; sitting at a table and using one-word suggestions from the audience to inspire scenes. 

Ultimately, each theater will pick a winning team and send video of their set to Earwolf. These teams will compete in a national round, and the national champions will win a trip to New York City, and a slot performing at the Del Close Marathon with Matt Besser! 

Right now contest4improv4humans is happening in theaters in sixteen cities across the country:

Obviously this is different for open longform improv, rather than games that might include props or costumes or like mousetraps for something specific. 

Additions I do like and have included:

-more chairs and stools and blocks

-improvised musical accompaniment

-tech booth lighting effects (fades between scenes, spotlights, different set-ups and colors, gobos and projections)

It's going to be the last Wednesday of every month and it's a 3 month trial period. The room costs no money upfront and the promoter takes a quarter of the door, so if it fails it won't cost me anything, no harm no fail.

There's currently very few places that do improv in Sydney so it's important to me that this room offers opportunities for newer improvisers to perform. I'm throwing around a couple of ideas for a format at the moment but this is the one I'm most drawn to;

Two halves of 40 minutes each with a 10 minute break in between. The first half would be ""open mic"" improv where 3 teams will have 10 minutes each to do improv anyway they wish (this would give newer improvisers much needed stage time and offer opportunities for more experienced improvisers to experiment a little/not get rusty). The second half would be the ""main act"" which would involve more experience improvisers performing a form I'm work shopping at the moment, that is basically an Armando/ASSSSCAT except instead of getting a suggestion from the audience we put the monologist's iphone on shuffle and the first song that pops up will be the impetus for the monologue. I think this will allow me to balance my goal of the room being a place that supports new improvisers while also offering a quality show that will have the audience feel like they're getting their money's worth.

A while back I made a post about knowing when it is time to leave an improv group. The post has been deleted, but I mentioned that I've been playing with the thought of leaving my group for reasons that vary from not having my voice heard to having a different style. I hated the way I sounded.

Well, we had the show last week and it went great! Everyone was really sharp and on their game and everyone made each other look good. On top of all that, we got a TON of laughs too. Plus, I didn't feel bad about myself or the show, and this is the first time I've felt good after a show with this group! I had a friend recorded the show, and while we had some stuff that we need to polish up, it was a very solid show. Our best one yet.

What I did differently this time around was making sure that I had enough energy (had some coffee and a sandwich beforehand), feeling good physically and mentally, and have a moment to myself before the show to collect my thoughts and focus. But most importantly, I reminded myself of the fundamentals of improv and conform to the group's energy and style. Both of those were tracks that I kept on repeat in my head throughout the entire show.

Personally, I think as we go on in our improv journey we sometimes forget the basic fundamentals and reasons why we do this art form in the first place. I went back to the drawing board and fixed what was wrong. I don't remember who all gave me the helpful feedback, but it is much appreciated and made me realize that I was in a toxic mindset going into the show and I needed to fix it asap.

improv,"So for the past year, I've taken a noticeable interest in comedy and improv. It started out with just seeing youtube clips of my favorite comedians, to listening to podcasts, to then realizing that one of the most rewarding things in my life is the ability to make other people laugh. I went to an Improv Asylum show once and I really enjoyed it. Friends of mine with comedy backgrounds (university students) have written jokes from me and they've noticed that I enjoy doing bits with them and keeping them going.

I don't really know techniques. I'm not incredibly quick-witted at all times. I might be terrible for all I know. I'm not sure what the end-goal would be. Become an actor? Unlikely. Improviser? Maybe. A more funny and confident person? I sure hope so. I'm pretty soft spoken in my day-to-day life. But I love comedy, writing, and I would love to try it out at least once. 

So I figured that since I am in college, I should try getting involved in the easiest way possible, by joining my school's team, or at least going to shows. I've also never really gotten involved in anything extracurricular, but if I had to, this would be it. 

The only problem is, I only have 2 more semesters left before I graduate. I'd be getting involved pretty late in the game. 

The biggest roadblock, however, is that my ex-boyfriend is a main cast member in my school's team. I think he joined last year. He's always at shows. My city also has a pretty small comedy/improv scene and I'm always terribly nervous I'd run into him at a show or if I ever auditioned. 

Background between me and him: he's more a pseudo ex-bf. We were friends for a whole year. We were close friends, he was into comedy. I liked him, he didn't, he punched me in the mouth with his lips a few times, and I pressed on about it too much. We fell out of touch completely. Quite awkward of me to just randomly show up at a show, right? I've moved on since then, and my current boyfriend knows about the ""situation"". He's encouraged me to go, but I'm just hesitant that:

a) it'd be painfully awkward to go to shows

b) pseudo ex bf would see this as a ploy of mine to get closer to him again. I mean, it WAS all I ever did last year (me trying to get closer to him) until our friendship deteriorated. 

c) there'd be bias against me being in the group because of him (this is a stretch, pretty early to tell if I'd even audition)

What would you do? Should I just hold onto my interests and wait longer? Move and start improv somewhere else because the chances of me running into him in this city are pretty dang high even after we graduate? Try to make amends, be casual, mend the friendship so there can be room for me too? Just go to shows not involving my university (pretty sure this guy is always at these improv shows excluding school too.. ugh)? I'd love to have some sort of creative outlet and I want to see of this could be it.

Am I being absurdly neurotic? Please help!

TL;DR: Afraid of running into ex-bf by joining my school's improv/comedy scene. ALSO, more importantly, I'd like some advice on how to get involved for the first time, never been a performer or anything!

improv,"I think I've heard before that all improv games can be put into a small number of categories. Is there an article somewhere where that's lists them? How many are there?

I ask because I had an idea for improv practices:

instead of only practicing specific games, we spend a lot of time practicing a small number of very generic games each in one of the different categories. 

We currently don't play a ton of games, or at least we don't add new games to our rotation. But I feel like if we had, say, 5 different barebones games, each with different *types* and practiced them a lot, we could focus our practice more on the general idea of the game and eventually open it up to more variety and bring in more and more gimmicks. 

I say this because often time in practice we get caught up in these gimmicks or modifiers of the games and forget that we are improvisers.

improv,"In the improv world does the term 'Mainstage' refer to any house team that plays on the main stage, a special 'best of' house team, or the actual main stage? I hear it used in phrases like ""he plays mainstage"" ""it takes an incredible amount of work to get to mainstage"", etc. How is it different than a 'house team', is mainstage a level above or interchangeable? 

For example I went to see some shows at UCB and Magnet's prime slots on Saturday night, are these (house?) teams (Goat, Airwolf, Trike etc) considered their 'mainstage' shows? I'm confused because at second city it seems like you just go see the ""Mainstage show"" on the main stage. Even more confusing in Philly the theater has a team called ""Phit Mainstage Team"" of top players that plays on their main stage on Friday and then other 'house teams' with regular improv names that play on the same main stage on Saturday. If you play in one of UCB's prime slots would you say you play UCB 'mainstage'? Do Second City ""mainstage"" troupes have actual team names (like Goat, Airwolf, etc) or are Second City and Phit unique in that they have an extra level above 'house team' that takes on the 'mainstage' title that theaters like UCB/Magnet do not?

improv,"Does anyone here perform improv under a stage name for yourself as an individual, or do you know someone who does?  I'm considering getting into improv/comedy in general, but I also have grandiose long-term ambitions and would love to be known professionally with my middle name as my last name, as my last name is frequently mispronounced while also being catchy to the point of distraction (it's not an embarrassing last name, just one of those unusual ones that stands out to the point where people call me it like it's my first name).  Plus, my first and middle name are an alliteration with a nice rhythm (think Ryan Reynolds, Lauren Lapkus, etc).  As an added bonus, there's no one on IMDB with this name (or my legal name, of course).

My other question is, if I sign up for my Level 1 improv class with this stage name while my email address and credit card feature my legal name, will this set me up for ridicule within the community?  I may be a bit vain and self-obsessed, but I prefer to keep that under wraps ;) 

I do plan to move to LA in the next year, now that I work remotely, and get involved with UCB or similar, so should I just save my stage name for then?  For context, I currently live in a relatively minor improv market that isn't Chicago or NY.

improv,"I have two questions about improv classes/shows/performances.

1. I took improv 101 over the summer. I want to continue moving up in levels and take 201, but it probably still won’t be for a few months. I’m taking classes through the UCB, and I know that you can’t take the next level if it’s been longer than 2 years (I think?) since the last time you took a class, but is there a certain amount of time that you think is *too* long to take in between classes? For, say, fear of not remembering what you learned or being rusty?

2. I get really anxious before each class, and before performing. I really like improv once I’m actually doing it, but being in front of people makes me nervous, especially because I worry what they think of me, if I’m funny, etc. I’m sure a lot of people deal with this, but I’m wondering how you guys do it. I spend a lot of time convincing myself it’s going to be ok, and trying just to ignore my nervousness.

improv,"Hi everyone,  I'm an improv amateur who is interviewing for a position at an afterschool program for kids aged 7-10.  I'm supposed to plan a quick 30-min lesson for my 2nd interview.  I'll be doing a project with 25 kids aged 7-10 (grades 2-5). 
 
Does anyone have experience doing improv with kids that age, and if so, do you think they will be successful playing Party Quirks for the first time?  It's the game where there is a host and 3-4 party guests; the host has to guess who/what each party guest is.  

I'm supposed to plan a **""cornucopia""-themed lesson/project**, and it's supposed to explore ""thankfulness, giving, and sharing"".

So I was thinking of doing Party Quirks in 5 groups of 5, each group with 1 host and 4 guests.  The guests would pick a slip out of a hat which I've prepared with things that someone might need (e.g. a hat because their head is cold; a dog because they want to go on walks with a friend).  Then the host would have to guess what the guest needs, and then ""give"" it to them.  

**My question is, do you think kids aged 7-10 would be successful and have fun playing this game?**  It's been a long time since I was that age, so I don't remember whether I played that game that young or whether it's a game for kids a little older.

I have to have my lesson plan in by tomorrow (Fri), so any insight ASAP would be greatly appreciated!

improv,"Hey r/improv, 

I direct a long-form college team of around 10 improviser at a larger West-coast state university. I'm the most experienced team member and this is my second year directing. 

Our team has historically (~15 years old) had a pretty strict attendance policy, and we've had only one team member question it. Long story short, this team member made a large fuss about a rule we've all followed based on the argument that they don't need as much practice since they do theater. 

This improviser is in their second year on the team, and I feel they are setting a bad example for the newer members. I also feel that they are not a particularly strong improviser. They have argued (fairly non-aggressively) with my notes on a few occasions, and I want our team environment to be an open forum, but I don't know how to handle someone arguing with me. Their theater experience obviously hasn't been particularly helpful to their improvising, and I've been on this team two years longer and don't feel that this argument is appropriate. 

Have any directors had similar experience? How can I foster a learning, open environment and address this person's argumentative tone?

When I booked my tickets to New York, they were doing level 1 intensives every week and level 2 intensives twice a month, but I got nervous when nothing was announced in my time period for ages (10/27 - 12/08). Today they announced what seem to be the last two level 1 intensives of the year, and one of them is in the last week December, the last one is in the last week of November. So I can only do the latter, but it will only be the first intensive, which I only really wanted to do to be able to do the second intensive (I've heard Besser talk about the first course being similar to most improv schools, and it's from the second course they start being unique), and I kind of also wanted to do the course to meet like minded people in New York so I could make friends, which is pretty useless when it's at the end of my trip.

So I think I'm going to pass on it, even though it why I came here (which is not the bummer it sounds, with concerts, NYCF and general New York Comedy, I have a lot to do), and try and find some cool improv things to do while in New York and was hoping Reddit would have some suggestions.

improv,"I've heard a lot of people say that anyone can do improv, and that it's for everyone. I've even read a great book named, ""Improv for Everyone"" by Greg Tavares. However, the longer I perform the more I realize there are people who have taken just as many classes as I have, or performed for as long as or longer than me, but still seem to not even grasp basic concepts like listening or even agreeing. I realized before I even began typing this post that this can come across very haughty and dickish - but my point isn't that I think I'm good and other people suck - in fact I don't really have a point, I wanted to see what you guys think about the idea that everyone can do improv. It’s interesting to consider that with almost every other art form, we’re quick to point out if someone isn’t very good and that they need to go back to the basics and learn more – ie. painting, singing, writing – yet with improv we hardly ever do this. Perhaps it’s because even the most vetted, talented improviser can still bust out a shitty show once in a while, and no one wants to seem like a hypocrite. 

I tend to agree with people who think certain communities or theaters do their students a disservice when they advance anyone who is willing to pay to the next level. I know certain schools in LA, Chicago and New York don't automatically advance students just because they sign up for the next level, and I wonder what it would be like to be in a community like that. I also see the benefit of creating an encouraging community where taking chances and failing is part of the journey that makes us all better. I know I really sucked at one point, and depending on who you ask or who has seen what shows of mine, some could say I still do, so I remain objective. So maybe being graduated and given chances to perform made the most difference for me and will for others as well. This is long winded, but I'm interested to see what you guys have to say - should we encourage everybody to do improv no matter what? When/how do we communicate to people that something is just not clicking with them and that they need to retake a course or grasp a basic concept, or could it ever be that maybe improv just isn’t for some people?

I've never gotten any sort of negative feedback from anyone, just constructive criticism and I've always strived to use it.

BUT.....

What if somehow I offend the ""gatekeepers"" (Meaning the owners and managers of the theaters and those who make the schedules and cast shows)? What if I post something on social media that upsets them? Or what if they're in the audience when I have a bad show? That has happened one time where a theater owner saw me perform in probably my worst show ever (And this is the only time he's ever seen me perform), so I am convinced that he thinks I'm a terrible improvisor and I'm pretty scared of that fact. I always feel awkward and nervous around the gatekeepers even though, again, they have always been nice to me. But still, if I'm talking to them, I just feel so much tension in my whole body and I'm worried that they can sense that I am very intimidated by them. I don't think anyone but total narcissists like to come off as intimidating so, again, I'm worried that they don't like me based on that. 

I'm honestly afraid of posting this because I feel like someone from the community is going to recognize my writing style and think I'm stupid. 

Anyway, does anyone else feel this way or felt this way at the beginning of their improv career? How did you get out of it?

Thank you for reading to the end if you got this far.

improv,"So one of my improv strengths has always been hard, animated reactions and very distinct characters. However, these character can often come off as hollow and lack depth because I get so caught up in making them in the first place. So naturally my coach gave me some great advice on this, but I'm wondering what are some ways that I could work on this and develop more depth in my characters. He challenged me to stop playing such characters (e.g. the elderly, Russian woman, kid with spastic attention issues) and to just feel comfortable playing ""myself"" in scenes.

improv,"WARNING: I know this is hella long. I'm just hoping someone might see some commonality in their life and give me some advice!

I’ve always loved to make people laugh. As a kid I would sneak out of my bed and write jokes in my closet (I don’t know why my closet, kids are weird and it worked). Before every Girl Scout Camp I’d make lists of jokes to drop on my fellow Brownies during the long car ride. At least 1 full page was devoted to Yo Mamma Jokes. That page was usually confiscated by a scout leader before I could finish it ;)

I hard a hard time making friends in middle school and high school. I turned shy and withdrawn (turns out I actually have social anxiety). I never stopped telling jokes, even when they were hard to get out because I was afraid of talking. I had a hard time even answering questions, so getting a joke or witty comment out wasn't easy. When I did they were usually met with hard-nosed stares. I had a bully that compounded my issues by following me around and yelling over me when I tried to speak. She said the same things nearly every time ""You're stupid"" and “You’re not funny” (Somehow as a kid those cut me to my core! That's german engineered insults for ya, simple and efficient). The responses to my attempts at comedy kind of fed my regression and my social anxiety worsened. 

Funny is subjective, of course. But I felt some glimmer of hope in my comedy when I found out my older brother regularly used my jokes on his friends to frequent success. I chalk some of it up to the environment. My family was entrenched in the Southern Baptist church, an already oppressive environment, especially towards women who were to be seen and not heard. 

Today I’m on the house team for the biggest theater in my city. After being auditioning and getting on the team we began new member training. And each week I found myself regressing. I noticed the dynamic between myself and the co-owner/co-leader of our theater echoed that of the kids back in my younger years. In one way or another he regularly communicates that I am lucky to be here, that I’m not good enough to be on the team, and that I can’t compare to everyone else with extensive improve experience (I’ve been doing improv for 1 year and a half). He's made it very clear that he believes I'm talentless and will not be putting me in shows. Recently that echo of “You’re not funny” started creeping back in my head. 

I know this is only affecting me because it’s kind of connected to my past. Normally I can shake things off pretty well, but this I can’t seem to kick. I'm stuck in a rut now, I’ve come to hate improv over the past few months. I dread going to practice. I’m bogged with self-doubt. I can’t seem to hold together a good scene. I started improv to help my social anxiety, and it did, I made major strides. But ever since I started training for the house team it’s worsened.

I’ve decided to take a break for a month, to assess things. I’m embarrassed to say I’m seriously considering quitting. In many ways, I feel like I’m broken. I can’t seem to “work” in scenes. I love comedy. I love a lot of people on the team. I used to love improv. I just feel lost.

improv,"Hello,

[I posted a bit back asking about the Groundlings audition.](https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/54i8e0/tell_me_everything_i_should_know_about_the/) I got a helpful response but figured I would just make a post going more in detail in case you, like me, are someone on this sub looking for info.

I scheduled the audition online. The slots were for 2 hours, but we were only there for about 90 minutes. I brought my headshot/resume and most people did but it didn't seem like it was a big deal for the few who didn't. 

We did two warmup games. The first was sending a sound/physicality around the circle, like when you play telephone. We then did what Groundlings calls ""walk and talk"" where we walked around the room normally but then the instructor says ""you're a XYZ"" and you take on whatever walk/mannerisms/facial expressions you interpret that as. Then the instructor will ask you to stop where you are, keep your mannerisms, and 'monologue' at an imaginary character. So, for example, we did scientist and I was just super curious and talked to an imaginary barista about what they put in their drinks as if it were an experiment. In the audition setting though, no way the instructor could individually hear us so I think she was just seeing if people felt comfortable doing it.

Then we each did two scenes. The instructor provided the examples. Sometimes it was just two characters, like you are two people in a retail store. Sometimes it was two characters AND their situation, like you're a mom and son and he's about to go to college. Before you do these scenes, the instructor explained a bit of improv principles. I liked how she talked about don't do ""Yes, anyways"" where you don't deny the situation but just change the subject.

It was fun and relaxed. There were a LOT of people there who said they had agents/managers and that they were auditioning pretty much because they were told to. I passed the audition and am really excited. The few people I felt may not have were very uncomfortable with even the warm ups, like you could tell they felt stupid or something.

improv,"Been at this for less than a year with some locals with a mix of experience/training levels. We've had some bad shows, but we all knew this was coming eventually: the first time we got up there and just ate shit with a snow shovel. Everything from the macro level to the micro level went wrong, from botched longform structure to blown tagouts to physical endowments denied to juvenile, off-game misogynistic ""jokes"" to pacing and energy level.

A couple very short exchanges as we fled the scene last night confirmed the vibe is most accurately described as ""funereal"".

Cognitively, I was prepared for this. I've heard enough interviews with performers I respect to know that ""I sucked out loud last night and now I want to quit improv"" happens to everyone at some point. And so at the cognitive level, I know that this is just the nature of the beast; one shitshow by itself isn't a reason to give up, it doesn't cancel out all the good shows you've done, and if you keep at it with a positive attitude the roller coaster will -- probably, maybe -- sooner or later point in the opposite direction.

So, given that (I think) I've got a handle on the emotional end, our next group practice is tonight and I'm contemplating what *concrete, practical* behaviors people have found helpful. I see a spectrum running between the extremes of:

* acknowledge it and then move on with normal practice as though nothing happened or needs to be fixed, to:

* get out the microscope and do a full 9/11-commission report on every bad decision so we know what to work on

I can see upsides and downsides to every point in between on the spectrum. I also know that I make terrible decisions, especially under emotional duress, and radically overreact at some times and underreact at other times. I can see how at one end there's the risk of not learning from my mistakes and just repeating them, and at the other end the risk of generating a ton of salt-in-the-wound negativity in the group by turning it into a mutual complaint-fest.

TL;DR: I don't need hugs or hang in there kitty posters, but I'd love to hear people's real-world experiences with having adopted different forms of ""nothing to see here, move on"" vs. ""lets do a complete tear-down and re-build"" in the immediate aftermath.

Compared to many of the people I improv with, I have a shallow knowledge of pop culture (specifically movie and tv references - I do okay with music references). This is a result of A) Not exposing myself to very much tv/movies and B) Not having the best recall when it comes to actor names/titles. In the past couple years I have stayed current on new releases and popular shows - but so many of the references people use are from older movies that I wasn't exposed to (this problem is especially prevalent when I am the youngest in a group (I'm in my mid 20's).

When a reference is made that I don't understand, I sometimes struggle to make the action keep flowing. I haven't performed live yet, so I'm not up on stage completely bombing bits...but I do feel like I'm missing an opportunity to play off of my ignorance instead of avoiding it. 

If any one has suggestions as to how I can play off a missed reference that would be great. Specific examples would be amazing! I listen to many of the popular improv podcasts and I know there are examples of people working with a missed reference, but none come to mind.

Additionally, if anyone has encountered this, and has taken steps to broaden their pop culture knowledge I would be interested to hear about your process.

I had a few questions on scene hogging in long form. from what I understand, it is when a player takes over the entire scene without listening and directing how the scene goes. this was sparked after reading this article:

http://jimmycarrane.com/what-to-do-if-there-is-a-stage-hog-in-your-improv-class/


1.  Billy Merrit of UCB says a good question: are you calling someone a stage hog because you are taking too long waiting in the sidelines trying to come up with idea? 

a. how do you tell if you are making a bold character choice vs scene hogging. for example, I like to create bold characters. they listen, react and rarely go into monologues etc however, I can imagine how it might appear like I am attention hogging and dominating the scene. 

2.  Jill Bernard from Huge Theater says that sometimes scene hogs are just excited to help.

a. how do you tell if you are saving a scene from going stale vs scene hogging? I noticed in longform there might be moments where some players lower the stakes of a scene or the premises are unclear, vague etc. I noticed the same fellow player would chime in to be part of the scene always to rescue it....in longform that is. I always like when the this fellow chimes in because he usually gives nice offers to keep the momentum of scene forward; however, I can see how this would seem like he is in every scene. for context lets pretend its a group of 5 players doing longform. 

",scene hog: signs and symptoms of this deadly disease?
improv,"im feeling kinda down after my improv auditions today for my college troupe. I feel like I may have screwed up in hindsight.


we did longform.

first longform scene, there was a scene with two people. Tom was about to touch a button, but Cynthia stopped him because it will explode the entire world ifyou do.

I was taught to be aware of the stakes in the scene by my teacher so I wanted to raise itby coming in and pressing it. I then saw their reactions and since there was a space where nothing happened.... I committed by pressing the button more manically. But when Cynthia said, do you feel that? I said no, while Tom said yes.  I was gonna press it again and say oh now I feel that but our jury cut the scene short and I feel like the jury thinks I am not a supportive partner. mind you I was abld to support my partners really well in all the scenes except this one.

the other audition I messed up when talking a bit. I was trying to end the scene by using a narration:
""and so our family was reunited again, once they hated eaxh other but now they became the bestest of friends. some even bullied each other....""

and also in a scene when I fumbled a few words in the sentence. I went with the mistake but I feel the fumbling of words was minus a few points for me lol.

I'm in a smaller improv community in Kansas City, the main theater in town has a rapidly growing training center and many students feel lost after going through all 4 levels, if they don't make it on the main stage team when auditions come around they can feel directionless and quit.

My question is how do you encourage indie development (WRT teams and growing an indie scene) without making students feel like they're just being made to pay for one more thing (coaching fees, rehearsal space, possibly renting a theater to produce their own shows)

I get that passion needs to be part of it. If one wants more stage time one must work for it, but it's a lot more difficult to let people know what they can do in a population that doesn't have the these options ingrained in the culture.

Using my own twitter account (different username) I retweeted back to the school and included this particular teacher with ""I wouldn't recommend it. One teacher laughed at my speech impediment in class &amp; tried to pass it off as banter.""

The school account then followed me. So they've at least seen it and are aware of it.

It really doesn't matter what it is I can't seem to play like I normally do. Which sucks because I know they specifically asked me to play with them because they wanted me to bring my own style to the set. And I don't do that. I instead just freeze up and never make any of the bold, reckless moves that I would normally make when I'm in scenes with troupes I am a part of.

improv,"While visiting Grand Rapids I caught a shortform improv show that was mostly great. Confident players, good showmanship, well done games, and they'd clearly built up a great audience. 

But during forward/reverse two male improvisers kissed each other, and the audience laughed at it--I wish they didn't, but they did. So be it. But then the troupe made a point of then going forward and reverse over the kiss often, including slow motion on it, and I just about walked out of the theater. 

I HATE THIS. It bothers me that two male improvisers kissing often gets audiences to laugh, and two female improvisers kissing often gets audiences to make lurid woots. So be it (but I hope this will eventually change). But it really pains me to see improv troupes playing up same-gender physical affection as being comical. It strikes me as being similar to a racist minstrel show, but regarding homosexuality. 

To be clear, the complaint isn't at all against same-gender kisses on stage (I happen to be straight, and I think I've kissed as many if not more male scene partners as female scene partners in scenes).  It's treating or playing that up as inherently comical that really strikes me as offensive.

improv,"hi,
I recently took another improv class taught  by an experienced improviser.

today two people came up and did a scene together.
Jackie, initiated that he was pregannt.

jackie:
I dont know if I should keep it.

Ryan responded:
""no, of course not. you should keep that food baby""

our instructor said that this made him upset because Ryan changed the reality of Jackie. 

we had a discussion about it and now I want to know what reddit/improv thinks.

scene 2:

sam jumps around waves her hand in air.
chris is about to throw a baseball.

chris: okay sis, lets swing the bat now!

sam stops waving her hand, and picks upthe bat. she acts stupid like she dont know hwo to play baseball and swings, hitting chris in the nutsack.


there was a reality change in this one to, for example sam didnt have a bat but was waving her hands, bit she quickly adapted. our instructor didnt have an issue with this.



these were all very short scenes. like a 3-4 lines type of exercise.... 

MY OPINION as of now:

I think the first scene could have worked if the scene was longer. it could have been a big story about how food baby needs to go for adoption etc.

however my opinion on making offers is they should ideally affect only your own reality rather than your partner's.

Edit:

improv,"Hi,
I have a team related question and would love any thoughts. I am a member of a 6 person group in a smaller city without a huge scene. Because of that, there aren't really any coaching options, so we've been self-running our rehearsals. (But are planning to switch to skype coaching with a coach from a bigger city). After doing this for a few months, it's become apparent that the ability levels on the team are all over the place, and that a couple of members in particular aren't at the level where they should be performing. I think a lot of this would've been avoided if we had a coach/director, but I am wondering if anyone has had experiences in having to kick members off a team? There is the option that the 4 of us could start our own thing and 'leave' the group, but that seems super shitty and passive aggressive. I imagine no matter what, feelings will be hurt, but would be good to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation and handled things in a way that wasn't a complete disaster. ",Kicking Members off of a Team?
improv,This is something I would like to work on. Any suggestions?,What are good games to help improve enunciation/speech rhythm/voice volume/etc?
improv,"Hey fellow improvisers, I recently saw my coach perform with a bunch of other improvisers and my mind changed a lot about what is steamrolling versus a strong offer? What I mean by strong offer is an offer that helps establish the ""who, what where and when?"" in the scene, or adds depth to the situation.

So I saw in the show (experienced improvisers/ award winning comedians etc), which was great, that some of the improvisers when starting the scene, would talk for at least 10 seconds, where they would provide backstory, relationship etc. to their partner. I will type out the examples from the show:


Phil and Jane are sitting together. Phil wraps his arm around Jane's neck. 

P: I love that you still come over here to watch ""walking dead"" with me, every sunday, even though we are divorced already. It makes me feel like you still care deep down.

J: I'm here because I don't got cable dammit.


To me, I felt this was great initiation because it gave a lot of context to play with. It establishes a lot of things necessary for good storytelling, such as relationship, setting, etc. For me i would have enjoyed this offer by Phil, however, I can see how this is in a sense forcing an idea on another person.
scene went great.

Then there was another example. This one occured a third of the way into the scene:

gardener and single-woman.

S: Well, I guess I'm gonna have to pay you now for finishing my lawn.

G: No, No. You don't actually have to pay me.

S: What's the catch bro?

G: No catch. I'm actually a missionary from Spain. I heard that women in North America often need their lawns trimmed, so I left my country to volunteer and make sure that no woman's lawn was ever too bushy.

S: Well, you don't say. I'm gonna call  and tell all my friends about it...

scene went great, and other improvisers started asking how her lawn looked so amazing and if it was possible to hire a missionary from Spain for them etc. However, I have seen people in my class be told to keep it short.

So interested to know what the improvisers on here think about the difference between steamrolling vs strong offer.

improv,"Hi everyone, in my second city level c classes, we are playing with character statuses.

I am aware that the only person I can control is myself, so any workarounds to these problems for myself would be appreciated.

So I noticed there are common safe 'go-to' choices when playing with statuses. I would like to ask help to workaround scene issues and different choices one can make when playing a specific status. I find myself not really able to have much creative contribution to the scene. Ultimately the result of these choices are that every scene more or less looks like the previous scene from the other improvisers. I have no problem carrying these safe scenes to the end, but I'd like to spice things up a bit for my own personal growth.

The same characters keep popping up, just with different occupations and played by different improvisers. overall its the same ""scared"" and ""aggressive"" dynamic.

1. 

How to play low-status if entering a scene with a ""safe high-status bully"" partner? 

I find sometimes the players I work with choose to teach, and take the socially expected superior role, and though this can be high-status without a doubt, I find what ends up happening is I run out of creative ways to heighten our statuses.

I have ways of working around it. 
An example is if my teacher is yelling at me about how stupid I am etc. Then what I will do is try to act more stupid or sabotage myelf at a task in order to make my partner look good and myself look like a pathetic little ****  I love doing that, except I am running out of creative ways to heighten the statuses for both of us.


So far I tried a few things physically:
-get on my knees and start kissing the floor they walk on
-injure myself so that the audience feels bad that I still have to carry out my high status partner's demands

any other ways to work around these scenes?

2.

Is there a way to talk more as a low-status partner, if your partner is choosing to be a ranting, yelling and verbally abusive high-status partner?

There is not much dialogue I can give myself in these cases other than agreeing with my partner's insult and insulting myself as well.

I have tried implying a backstory so the audience gets our relationship, and also imply a backstory so that my partner can take it as an offer. for example:
""I know I screwed up but, please don't bring the belt""
Luckily, my partner took it as an offer and decided that this time he was gonna bring the shark tank as punishment. 

other than that, I feel there is not much contribution I can give other than being this type of high-status's character's little puppet which though fun, can get boring :(


3.

What emotional choices are there for a low-status character reacting to a high-status character?

Aside from scared and anxious. The other ones I can think of are ""madly in love"".

EDIT: I realized sanfranimprovman took my post very personally, it seems the word ""safe"" makes me appear egotistical.... anyhow, I think the most accurate term to describe these are ""safe choices"" and that they result in a steamrolling dynamic where the high status partner pushes a lot of his ideas onto the low status. 

so I am being a responsible improviser by asking how do I react in these situations when I am being steam rolled by safe choices like teachers characters and superiors etc, so I can make things funner for myself and everyone. 

lets not get too caught up in semantics now. 

EDIT:

a workaround is simply a fix, solution and way to respond to issues in a scene such as teaching tc. no need to blow the word out of proportion to what it is.

The crux of it is not thinking I'm good with others, as I can't really think quickly in social situations where others would do so smoothly. I also judge myself very harshly wherever I somehow do badly in social interactions. 

The flipside of this is that I love public speaking (prepared speaking), and I have a lot of belief in myself for that. I'm also interested in politics, just don't know if I'd be any good at it given that it's a relentlessly social occupation.

My question I guess is, can this sort of thing (quick thinking, humour, quick interactions) be learned through things like improv? Or are your born with it (or not)?

improv,"Hello, I'm Phil. I just did a one-man improvised show at the Edinburgh Fringe. I'm going to write up my show here. It's a description of what I did followed by a few things I learned from it personally. It may be of *no use to anyone whatsoever* and just be me blathering on, but if you're thinking of doing a one-prov show it might be useful. 

I posted about the show before I went away in this sub: 

[I am doing a one-prov. Is there anything I haven't considered?](https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/4pg23d/i_am_doing_a_oneprov_is_there_anything_i_havent/)    

Here's what I do in the show / how it ended up: 

------------------

#DESCRIPTION OF THE SHOW

(you can skip this if you don't want to read about my show)

------------------

* It's a 50-min show. About 5 mins of admin / warm up at the start, then 45 mins of improv. I was playing to about 20 people a night on weeknights, up to 50/60 on weekends. Not huge, but enough to have fun. Free show / pay what you want at the end. 

* Each scene was roughly 4mins, with my tech looking for an edit point (they'd play the music) at around 3min 30sec. 

* When they audience enter they don't know it's improv, including most of my friends that came to the show (I do a lot of improv, but my last two shows were written hours). [Here](http://imgur.com/a/GQT0n) is what the poster / flyer looked like.

* The show starts and I do some warm-up (crowd work, a few gags) and I tell them I'm going to do a ""Nothingist show (it's the latest craze!)"" and in order to do that you prepare nothing in advance. In fact I haven't even prepared any music. Can I borrow someone's phone? 

* That person's phone scores the rest of the show. I have a set up using OBS [seen here](http://imgur.com/a/DqZGl). I use CamTwist to ""live stream"" the presentation part of the screen, and VLC to play to back to the desktop, then projected on to a screen in the venue. The operator then alters the headings for the titles of the songs and the names of the scenes. 

* When a new song comes on between each scene I either do a gag on it or if it's appropriate to the narrative in some way, I'll weave it in 

* Then I have a series of cards on which is printed a series of prompts for the audience. I tell the audience I've prepared no material for *myself* but I have written some lines for *the audience:* they take the form of a fake argument about how much they don't like my show already: [seen here.](http://imgur.com/a/AszDJ) The fill-in-the-blanks become the scene titles. List of all the scene titles I took [here](http://imgur.com/a/uF7mY)

* The order was ""I like [scene 1, usually an object],"" ""I didn't study [scene 2, an area of study] to be treated like this,"" ""I'd rather be [scene 3, a location] than here."" And then the Video Game / TV show. 

* Then I do the usual ""this is all improvised..."" spiel. The suggestions come up on the screen, the first song plays, I do a weird dance do it as the first scene title comes up and I have two stools which I may use to put into place, and start improvising. 

* The structure is strongly based on the Harold. Three scenes, a palate-cleanser, three scenes, a palate-cleanser, something else, and then the third beat that meshes the narratives together. The palate-cleansers were a parody of an existing TV show, and me performing a new video game the audience had made up. 

* The video game consisted of me doing the intro logos (Sega / Nintendo / Playstation / XBOX) and then doing cut-scenes from the game, reaction videos on ""YouTube"", sometimes cut to the development process, or to the marketing guys, sometimes as the player trying to play the stupid game I've invented. 

* The ""something else"" (represented by the glitchy screen you can see in the OBS set-up) was an opportunity for me to explore something that hadn't been touched on in the show before, or briefly mentioned and not revisited, or else for two characters from the show to meet in a way they wouldn't normally, the characters would end this scene with a reference to how the show was free and putting money in the bucket at the end was encouraged. 

* Finally, after every show I wrote up the content of the show here: http://imgur.com/a/XZTJk (I'm British, so there's plenty of Brit references in there)

------------------

#WHAT I LEARNED

-------------------

* REPEAT SUGGESTIONS: If you've looked at the list of scenes you can see I got Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, and ""Big Butts"" a LOT. I had to learn to do something new with it each time. It wasn't always successful. When I pushed myself to go to a totally different place with it, it really flew, but if I felt stuck on the idea it was like wading through syrup. Game of Thrones scenes that I did were: John Snow trying to do stand-up, Hodor getting accidentally booked for a ""hoe-down,"" the Westeros Funeral Parlour being over-whelmed with dead bodies... These really went well. Doctor Who was more of a struggle. It was surprisingly hard to innovate around. What I ended up doing was bringing in a character from the previous scene to interact with The Doctor to move the narrative along. Big Butts became more difficult: There's only so much you can do with someone that's either obsessed with butts, or has a big butt before it starts feeling like you're doing the same scene as a previous show, just in a different location. 

* AUDIENCE MEMBERS BEING CLEVER: Due to the set-up of ""I like [blank]."" It would cause a very witty audience member to say ""I like big butts and I cannot lie"" a lot. Which is fine. But as the previous paragraph, it became difficult to innovate. The joke worked best when someone would shout ""I like cake!"" or ""I like beans!"" or ""I like you!"" It's a nice general word you can do anything with. In a ""normal"" call, you could do say ""haha, something else you like, please."" But due to this set-up I was stuck with whatever they said. If I'm doing it again, I'd like to find a way that I could avoid them saying ""big butts,"" when literally anything else (even ""penis"") I could work with, without feeling hack. 

* FEELING HACK IS INTERNAL, AND THE AUDIENCE DON'T NOTICE: On the flip-side, if a scene veers a bit near to something you did 8 shows ago, the audience isn't going to know or care. It won't be the same anyway, because you've got the whole rest of the narrative to contend with. 

* PLAY MORE CHARACTERS THAN YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH: If I was stuck in a two-character scene, I would bring a third character in. I used my standard go-to improv helpers: a mirrored character (a weird character would have an identical person, to make the straight guy look weird), an emotional character could come in to react to what was going on, a walk-by character could chip something in to help out the scene if it needed it, this also helped for stuff coming back in the second beat.

* INNOVATE ON THE SECOND BEAT: If something comes back for scene 2.x and it's not good, I'd tag myself somewhere else (usually by saying ""Cut to,"" or ""Meanwhile,"" or, ""Later..."") OR I'd bring in a new element. I was really stuck on a reality TV show scene about people discussing their exes, and it wasn't getting any laughs. And so I just threw in a parade of escaped monkeys, which in the next scene ended up fighting the Swiss Army, and pursuing a character from scene one. 

* YOU CAN START PUTTING NARRATIVES TOGETHER BEFORE THE THIRD BEAT: This is something I rarely see in Harolds, but became necessary for me doing an hour-long show, is that in the second beats, or the palate-cleansers, I'd start weaving in characters from previous scenes. That meant I could tie up some of their narratives early and forget about them for the rest of the show. 

* I LEARNED HOW TO ""PAINT"" and ""NARRATE"" IN A DIFFERENT WAY: I developed a conceit of narrating the show to do visual gags. In one scene, I blurted out (French accent:) ""I cannot come, I have to be the Eiffel Tower!"". When the scene came back, I signalled to my technician to keep the music going and I narrated a car chase through Paris as all the landmarks turned out to be giant women in disguise, slowly standing up and destroying the city. I would frantically jolt around inside the car whilst narrating the giant feet and slabs of marble crashing around me. Other times, I would describe someone falling off a cliff as if a narrator. 

* DOING SILENT SCENES: I developed with my tech a signal that I wanted them to keep playing the music, and I would do silent scenes. Bears falling in love, climbing Mt Everest, the car chase as above, weird Olympic games... 

* YOU CAN TALK IN A SILENT SCENE: But sometimes I hadn't got to my 4min mark and the scene had run out of ideas, but cutting too early would've left me with nothing to come back to. So taking the stage and the energy to speak often saved it from both running out of steam, and leaving me without something for later.

* YOU HAVE TO FIND WHEN YOUR ENERGY DROPS AND PICK IT BACK UP AGAIN: Sometimes I would notice myself getting a little laconic, or the scenes drifting and I would be getting tired. If this happened, I had to just bring in a new character, or tag my characters elsewhere, or suddenly have a reveal in the narrative to burst the energy back out again. 

* SOMETIMES YOU STRUGGLE IN THE SHIT AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT: But I kept struggling, and struggling, and trying to find the funny thing. Then when the funny thing came out (it sometimes took a minute or two) the audience would really go for it, then you could keep coming back to that game for a while and everyone felt safe. If I had abandoned the scene because it was shit, I would only have shit to come back to, and my whole show would be centred around this shit no-idea. So I kept plugging until I had a GOOD idea.

* PLAY CHARACTERS YOU AREN'T CAPABLE OF PLAYING: I'm not very good at accents. However, in the show I did Scottish, Welsh, Geordie, French, Spanish, Mexican, German, Swiss, Transylvanian, any US accent you can think of, and I'd just push myself there. And you know? After a while it wasn't half bad. I just threw myself into it and the audience either bought it, or thought my attempt was so ridiculous they loved it. I would also play women without using a silly voice (unless they were silly women, or an impression of a TV personality), just using my normal voice, but refer to the character as 'she/her.'

* BE NICE: There were times when I was tired and yesterday's show wasn't the best, it wasn't a big crowd, that I would be a bit down and a little bit grouchy. It made the scenes harder and it made me harder to like on stage. When the audience know that what you're doing is coming from a place of fun and enjoyment, they're way more likely to go with it, even if it's dark or satirical or scary. 

* DON'T BACK AWAY FROM DOWN-BEAT: In one show, the moon exploded at the end. And I described all the characters (Taylor Swift, Beethoven, an astronaut, a deep-sea diver, fishermen, Poseidon, the Queen) looking up at it, teary-eyed as their world was forever changed. A 14-year-old girl in the front row cried. Never done that before with improv. Very proud of that moment. 

* JUST SAY WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD: Even if it's really fucking weird. Even if it's really obvious. Even if it's a tired old joke. Even if it's really ""normal."" Just say it. Because the second thing won't be as clear, as good, lead you to as good a place as the first one would've done. 

* CATCH YOUR OWN MISTAKES: Notice when you say something wrong, pronounce a word incorrectly, contradict a previous character, block yourself, get someone's name wrong, forget something you did, repeat yourself. And comment on it. In one show I was miming typing and doing the clicky noises on the keyboard, which meant that character wouldn't talk and type at the same time. So I got some laughs out of that game. Then another character came in and thought the ""clickclickclickclick"" noises were the typing guy calling him a ""dick dick dick dick dick."" Scene made. 

* YOU CAN IMPROVISE FOR AN HOUR ON YOUR OWN AND IT'S STILL TREMENDOUS FUN AND EVERYONE WILL LIKE YOUR SHOW. Ibid.

I am also an occasional actor and more frequent writer and cartoonist. I wanted to create a webcomic that would give me something regular to publish while I go through the more laborious process of drawing my other comics, so I created one called The Insult (http://theinsultcomic.tumblr.com) which, like Dinosaur Comics, is the same pictures every time (usually) with different text.

It wasn't originally going to be improvised. Originally, I was a good little webcomicker with a ""buffer"" of a few weeks' worth of comics in the pipeline. But that dwindled away and by April or so, I found myself doing the comic the night before its publish date. And then, the morning of the publish date, which is how it has been ever since. People give me suggestions on tumblr and I have a database of ideas of my own. So now on publish days (M/W/F), I get up, pick a topic, google whatever I need to know about it, and write and publish the comic. It usually takes around 45 minutes from start to finish. (And yes, I did do one specifically about improv: http://theinsultcomic.tumblr.com/post/148735805164/98-improv-performer-this-one-is-all-too-real-i)

improv,"Hi fellow improv players!  Over last few years I've been more interested in ""applied improv"", especially in my professional field of engineering and education.  So recently I teamed up with a colleague of mine to propose a workshop at SXSW 2017, officially called [""Improv &amp; Art Games for Designers &amp; Engineers""](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/61557).  My hope is that the designers and engineers who come to SXSW Interactive check out the workshop, so we can test out the curriculum I've made up.  The short of it is that they'd play a lot of improv games that you all know, but that are specifically chosen to prime them for doing actual engineering design techniques (brainstorming verbally and graphically).  

It's been hard to round up interest from engineers/designers who haven't done improv before, so this venue would be a neat opportunity.  Coincidentally a lot of engineers/developers seem to be in the local improv community in Austin, but that might just be because it's Austin, and/or they have the financial freedom to take improv classes and do random shows.  But I think self-selection is at play; the engineers who already are more collaborative and open to ideas might gravitate toward improv, and they don't need any convincing about the value of it.  I'm hoping that a session like mine could attract those designers/engineers who are less open to improv, as maybe they are the ones who need it the most.

I'm struggling with thinking of appropriate games. Most would be too advanced. Of course if parents play, that would be great. But I want the games to be accessible to the 3-6 year olds as well.

Ideas so far:

///one-word-at-a-time story///

///vacation slideshow / ""CLICK""///
(--could ask an adult / parent to be vacationer maybe?)

///freeze tag///


Is there any way to make these games more simple / accessible? Or somehow add in emotions or animals, so the kids have something to grab onto??

I also have to be prepared that no one will want to play; no one will get it; no one will do it right. Not sure how to prepare for that ;)

Which speaks to a larger problem of how to create new long improv forms and structures. I believe very young performers make the mistake of creating complex flow charts and math-like patterns for their formats. 

I've found two good ways to go about creating a new form, and they also kinda loop around each other. The first is to focus in on and change/alter/expand/compress a single working element of a generic longform. The other is to choose a broad point you want to make—either thematically or stylistically—and begin figuring out what you would need to do in order to portray that.

I think the Harold, as its currently performed, is a bad form for performance. It's certainly not the worst form and good performers can make it entertaining, but in my opinion the form itself does not live up to its reverence. Too many theaters have ""Harold Nights."" Here are my arguments:

1) The Harold is Not Fun To Watch. It can be very hard as improvisors to differentiate what's fun for us to watch and what's fun for an audience who has never seen improv before. And then, consciously, make a decision deciding whether we want to do a show for comedy nerds or a broader show for everyone. In my singular opinion, the Harold is not fun to watch unless you are an improvisor who has studied the form itself. 

From the experiences I've had with non-improv friends I've gone to see Harold night with or have come to see house team shows where I do a harold of my own, they seem to be: A) bored or confused by the opening, B) confused as to why scenes that don't work initially (a bad first beat) are returned to and C) find the scenes uncomfortably long.

This of course, is all very subjective. But I tend to agree. A great improv team will do a great Harold, but they'll most likely do a great improv set no matter what form they do. So why do we have so many intermediate performers (usually everyone's first house team experience is to DO a Harold) doing such a notoriously difficult form that makes it harder for them to perform well on a consistent basis? Especially to people who don't study at the theater.

Even on the better end of the spectrum in Harolds, I often find myself more intrigued by how well they're following the structure then genuinely enjoying the performance on stage.

I believe that as comedians and performers it is our responsibility to put on a coherent and funny show that someone can enjoy whether they've taken no improv classes or a thousand. I feel the Harold is a good form for practice in this right, but makes little sense as a performance piece, especially when we want to perform for people outside of our bubble.

2) The Harold is not fun to perform. Once again, a great team can do a great Harold. And they'd probably have fun doing it. Shannon O'Neil recently said on You Made It Weird that if you're not having fun doing the Harold, you're not doing it right. That's a valid point. But then, once again, why is it the basis of so many schools if it is so notoriously difficult.

In most curriculum (on a 4 class scale) the Harold is introduced in the second level, taught fully in the third, and then practiced intensely in the fourth. Virtually no schools teach the Harold in the first level. Because it is a difficult form that puts many people in their head.

 But starting in level 2 you are taught the Harold, usually with a significant amount of importance on the form itself. You are taught the Harold is the key to being good a long form improv, and suddenly a godlike amount of importance is put on it. So what happens when so many students struggle with it? They get put in their heads. They lose the love of improv that initially started with level 1. They begin to conceive that there's a ""right"" way of performing and a ""wrong"" way of performing (to clarify this, there's certainly always rules that help someone's improv be more consistent and interesting, but in my experience the Harold's strict structure imply that there is a CORRECT way to perform long form improv)

This is pushed even further by the multitudes of ""Harold Night"" house teams throughout the country, consisting of 8 people who are randomly placed together and forced to follow the Harold structure.

I'm going to make a blanket statement here, but most Harold nights are not great. Io, UCB might be significantly better but even these are inconsistent at best. This is because Harold Nights force people who are inorganically placed on a team together to perform a piece of long form improvisation that might not be conducive to their collective voice / skill as a team. I've seen some great Harold Nights but I've seen more where small mistakes like a skipped second beat of a B scene, or a 1st beat that got one too many walks ons caused an immense amount of tension in the room. It feels like most teams are so scared to break the structure of the Harold, but they're simultaneously bored by it. The first beats, even when the people in the scene can't find a place to go, are followed through the end. More often than not I see people who are more content performing a structurally perfect Harold with no laughs than a messy Harold with high energy and inspired scenes.

3) The Harold is not the ""Harold."" This is a pet peeve of mine and drives me nuts. After so many hours of being taught the Harold, having the form stuck into my head over and over and over again, I've yet to see a theater that actually really lets a true Harold occur. 

The original Harold was a 40 minute form, and the group games were used as short-form game pallet cleansers. The thing that really justifies the Harold as the father of Long Form it's often held up to be is the 3rd beat. 

This is where everything comes together, the connections between the scenes are made, the thematic motifs are brought to the front, and the scenes are shot rapid fire on all cylinders until a tremendous blackout. As far as I can tell from Truth in Comedy, The UCB manual, and teachers throughout the years, the Harold is a slow burn that builds to a large and satisfactory conclusion. Except...You never see it happen.

The extreme difficulty of the Harold aside, these connections are almost never made because most Harolds get blacked out after the second group game. Or maybe even the first line of a third beat. Some just die after a wipe. This is because Harolds are 30-40 minute forms and Harold nights have teams doing 20-25 minute sets. 

Currently in New York City, you cannot see a full 40 minute harold anywhere. More often than not you'll never see a Harold get to the third beat. And what's a Harold without the connections made at the end? A slow, limited montage? 


4) In Conclusion: The Harold has a rightful place in history. It even has a rightful place in practice as a master class in long form comedy. But it's the basis of too many schools. Too many uninspired shows. 

I propose that:

1) The Harold is updated to make it more conducive to a 25 minute time slot.
2) Harold nights allow teams to find the long form that works best for their collective voice and perform that instead of the Harold
3) The Harold be less emphasized as part of an introduction to several long forms, allowing students to explore many different ways of performing long form rather than just being in their heads about one.

I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on the matter. And I'd love to be convinced that the Harold, somewhere out there, is truly the pure longform joy it's been built to be. I've just been yet to see it.

improv,"Hi everyone, 

So I was wondering aside from doing meetups.com and second city student shows, how does one get actual show experience?

It seems the only way people do so is through taking classes that allow you to perform onstage like in different levels of second city courses etc.

A lot of the shows or theatre requires that you had improv experience, so I assume this means you must have performed often in actual shows rather than just classes?

improv,"I've been doing improv for a little over a year now. I took classes at a local improv theater then auditioned to be a part of the house troupe a couple months ago and got in. But I feel like I've been in a rut lately. Ever since I started training with the house troupe all my scene notes seem to always be ""don'ts,"" but it's hard for me to figure them out because they seem to be contradictory. 

Below are a few examples. When I say “they” I'm referencing the 2 leaders of our troupe (who also act as instructors). In our troupe the only people that it's normal/accepted to get detailed personal critiques from are these leaders. Anyways, examples:

- They tell me to start with a strong emotion, then after the scene I'm told not to start with the emotion I chose.

- I 'm told to make bold character choices, but then I'm told not to use that character I chose and to change (this one is the hardest, a couple weeks ago one leader stopped me mid-scene and told me to stop doing a character because my character would impulsively snap her fingers and he didn't relate to it).

- We're told to have an energy balance of characters in the scene, like not to have three off the wall characters at once. But every time I play a character that isn't loud or dominant, I'm told I'm not matching my scene partner’s energy. But at the same time one leader just told me that one of my greatest strengths is how well I mirror my scene partners.

I feel like they're looking for me to make a very specific choice. And I think that cripples me because I feel like I'm not free to perform, like everything is scrutinized and I have to start a scene by figuring out what choice THEY would make rather than bringing my own personal experiences in. It's affected a lot of my confidence on stage and I struggle to actually be present in scenes now because I'm trying to filter everything and make the ""right"" choice.

I have to get them on my side because they choose show lineups and as of right now, they said they feel I'm not ready for shows.  Where I'm from this theater is the only improv option, so I can't go somewhere else, and I don't want to as I really like the people in my troupe. 

I agree with many of their critiques, I know I need to make bolder character and emotional choices. But it feels like every time I do, I choose wrong. I want to be better but it's really hard to do with all these dont's in my head. At this point I'm not really enjoying improv anymore.

improv,"First of all, let me start by saying, I really appreciate this community. It's already been very helpful for me. 

Now, the reason for my post. Asking a few noob questions and reading question threads started by other noobs, I've noticed a trend. 100% of the time, someone responds with ""Relax! You're still new!"", ""Don't worry, you've only been at it for ____ months"", or ""It's okay to suck at this stage of your learning.""

While I get these ""don't sweat it"" gestures, they're not helpful. IMHO, they're actually kinda frustrating. It's akin to ""You'll understand when you grow up."" Just because a person is new, doesn't mean they can't appreciate higher-level advice or that they deserve a dismissive ""Sure thing, Sport!"" type of response.

Imagine it in other scenarios: ""My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for 7 months, but no luck. Any suggestions."" ""Chill out. You'll get that baby eventually.""

Edit: Thank you for your thoughtful responses. I guess my issue has a lot to do with the idea of telling someone to ""relax"" or ""don't worry"".

improv,"So I was in a small event a few nights ago and we went up stage to perform.

For me I find that in improv, naturally many things are politically incorrect if you really wanted to go obsessive and uptight about it. There are things thta are pure nonsense but its inevitable to not bump into a sensitive topic. even if we refuse to see it. For example, throughout the show, we had a man preparing his wedding gown to get married (could be trans phobic) and a girl with daddy issues, socially awkward people and drug dealers who put on Mexican accent. Our host was also amking white jokes about herself which ise is self depreciating himor. Not to mention there was a scene with a professor who was raging at the class. She bassically met the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder and anger management. So you could argue they are making fun of mental illness if you wanted to be uptight. And of course depressed people came up.

So when I went up on stage with my partner, I got the feeling it was an uncomfortable joke I made. So we went to an adoption clinic and I said I would like to adopt an African American baby. 

My partner looked at me and said that it was my idea and not hers. She said she was ipen to all ethnicities of babies. So she still rolled with it but I wasn't sure... the audience was laughing (they are all improvisers btw). We were holding hands like any couple would

So the receptionist offered us a baby that my partner reacted disgusted towards (it was an obese impvisor) and asked ""what is that thing?"". I reacted positively to give contrast and said that we should totally adopt her. I wasnt sure if this was out of the line but I pulled ""the baby"" towards us and said how adorable she is amd turned her to the audience. My partner said ""honey, let me handle this"". She then tuned to the receptionist and said ""dont mind him"". Dont knoe if touching the other performer was a good idea

Then we cut to the part after the adoption and we had a scene of us staring at the baby on the floor not knowing what to do. That was all.

Im probably overthinking this, because I felt if it made peiple uncomfortable someone would end the scene? Our host and her co producers would have walked across the stage to end scene or called out fast forward or tag me out if it was too much? 

I for some reason feel my partner was giving me subtle hints that I was either doing smth wrong in the scene like overdoing it or had bad timing? Why im self conscious about this is there is a huge politcal correctedness trend nowadays and though I agree that hate speech is awful, I dont know where to go in improv. As you have seen in my previous examples, improv can and in this particular show poke on sensitive topics whether ppl realixe it or not (mentally ill, social awkwardness etc).

For me a part of why I was confused was because our host who was also on the side waiting to jump in told another girl on the side across the stage to ""keep it positive"". This happened because the two ppl performing on spotlight had an affair with the gardener and his hose got caught in her hair. The girl across the other side of stage yelled ""dont you mean your hose was caught in your ass?"". She was a performer and we are allowed to as performers to yell out suggestions to change the scene up.

Idk it was confusing. This was my first lol

improv,"This may be a bit of a shit post but I don't care. I just wanted to put this out there

I took a few improv classes in high school (an intensive and a legit level A class) and really enjoyed it at the time. But, for no real good reason, I never continued with Level B and always kind of regretted it. 

Now, almost 10 years later, after ""real life"" and jobs and adulthood have happened, I decided to take a level 1 class again at the ripe age of 26.

And it feels absolutely phenomenal. I'm loving every minute in class and I'm definitely going to try and go out for a few jams. I feel like a new man!

So thank you improv for coming back to me and I'm definitely going to take that level 2 class now. ",Newbie (kinda) and I'm loving it!

improv,"Forgive me if this isn't related, but this seems like the best place to ask it.  I just started taking classes as UCB LA, and I noticed a few open mics and shows that are described as storytelling.  I'm going to try to catch one of these shows soon, but I was hoping someone could help me clarify the concept.  Is it, as I suspect, someone just telling a story?  Wouldn't that overlap with certain types of stand-up?  For example, when I see comedians like Gabriel Inglesias perform, I notice most of his routine is him telling stories about his life, career, friends, and family.  When people perform it, do they get a word and improvise the story, or, like stand-up, is it rehearsed?  Is it all comedic, especially in a comedy theater?

Once again, forgive my ignorance but I'm new to LA and haven't heard this term or seen these types of show being held back home.  Thanks in advance!",Storytelling in improv theaters?

improv,"We have what I will call ""The Repeat"" exercise. Two people sit or stand side-by-side and talk. The rule is that you have to repeat exactly what the other person says, and then you add something, e.g.  
Bob: I don't want to go to the park.  
Ray: I don't want to go to the park. Ok, instead let's go the museum.  
Bob: Let's go to the museum. The Art museum!  
Ray: The Art museum. We'll see lots of paintings.  
etc.  
  
Often it happens that the person will repeat the line but transpose the subject like so:  
Bob: I don't want to go to the park.  
Ray: You don't want to go to the park. Ok, instead let's go the museum.
  
This violates the rule. I'm all for rules if they serve a purpose. Does this rule serve a purpose?  
The only reason I can come up with to enforce the rule is that once you make one exception, then more variations will occur and the benefit of the exercise will be lost.

improv,"I'm looking into getting my first tattoo, and while doing research I had this thought: what if someone got a tattoo version of a Harold?  It might go something like this:

3 artists design tattoos design tattoos based on some initial inspiration.  Then, the ideas/aesthetics/themes of those tattoos design a second round of tattoos, and then finally the themes start to come together into a final tattoo (or into some piece that connects them all).

Example: the inspiration is ""just go with it,"" and the designs for the first beat are:  
* a bending tree  
* a bottle of liquor pouring out but the stream turns into a river  
* a replication of the DVD cover from the movie 'Just Go With It'  

The second beat might be:  
* A forest of sideways trees pointing towards a sideways sun  
* an hourglass but the sand is dumping onto a beach scene  
* an ebay listing of Adam Sandler movies with no bids (this would be the best tattoo, artistically speaking)  

Then the third beat, which in this case is just one tattoo:  
* It's an hourglass turned sideways, causing the trees on the beach to bend.  Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston are bring thrown against the far wall of the hourglass.  

My example is obviously bad on purpose, but I actually think a harold in tattoos would be super cool, and if you picked a theme with meaning to you it would have double depth (provided you are passionate about improv, and since you're here I assume you are.)

improv,"Back in February I performed in my 1,000th show as improviser / stand-up comedian. I tracked all of the shows in an excel sheet and decided to analyze them and thought others might be interested in seeing it.

Full analysis here: http://drewtarvin.com/comedy/in-depth-analysis-1000-performances/

General Highlights:

* I started doing comedy in October 2004.
* I performed 1,000 shows in 4,130 days or roughly 1 show every 4 days.
* I performed 7 types of shows, primarily shortform improv and stand-up, but also longform, musical, spoken word, storytelling, and sketch.
* I performed for 681 hours or roughly 28 days.
* I performed in front of an estimated 41,240 people.
* I performed in 104 cities, in 45 states, in 3 countries, and on 2 continents.
* I performed at least once every month from December 2007 to February 2016 (a streak of 99 months).

Improv Specific Stats:

* I did 673 improv shows. 436 were shortform, 172 were longform, and 66 were musical.
* Total performance time was just over 648 hours. The average duration of shortform was 75 minutes, longform was 23 minutes, and musical was 22 minutes.
* I’ve done improv in front more than 28,000 people. My biggest audience was 1,200, my smallest was 4.
* I’ve done improv in 20 states.
* The most improv shows I’ve done in a year is 118. The most in a month is 19. The most in a day is 4.

Edit to add some of what I've learned as a result of the analysis:

1. **On where to live.** Do you want to do as many shows as possible? Move to NYC, LA, or Chicago. Do you want to do less shows but for bigger audiences? Stick to a middle size city (aka small fish in a big pond).
2. **On performance type.** I strongly encourage all performers to try different types of performance, and not just different types of improv (shortform, longform, musical), though definitely do that. But doing stand-up for 5 minutes versus storytelling for 7 minutes versus 25 minutes for longform are all very different experiences and can all help make you a more rounded performer.
3. **Think about what you want.** I know some improvisers who look down on shortform or people from one improv school look down on people from others, which to me makes no sense. Think about what you want and then find what types of groups will help you get there. I tried a bunch of different things and then stuck to the ones I enjoyed the most.
4. **Invest in a group with people you like.** I've been on teams where I'm friendly with the other players and I've been on teams where I've been friends with the other players. The latter is definitely better and I did a lot more shows with those types of group.
5. **Find what motivates you.** I'm motivated by numbers, by specific goals that I can measure and track. It's what got me out to an improv jam when I didn't feel like leaving my couch. Figure out what will motivate you to get better.

I really liked her, as far to go and say loved her, which I told her via text. Of course, romantic rejection is like breaking your leg, the pain doesn't show up until later and when it does, it really makes you want to die. This friend of mine, she's what convinced me to get a career in comedy. I was shy before I met her and never said funny things out loud out of fear I'd look stupid. But, I wanted to impress her, and buying her chocolates and flowers, it just wasn't her thing, so I made her laugh and in the process of doing so, if required, I'd make the whole class laugh. I mean, before this I really only made my friends laugh; she gave me confidence to make a whole crowd laugh. I did that and enjoyed the hell out of it. Then, the rejection came and of course a cloud of depression loomed over my brain (unintentional rhyme). I lost confidence in myself and I haven't felt the same since. It feels like there's concrete in my brain and that spontaneous humor is banging against it, trying to get out but just can't.

improv,"Amherst, MA - July 5, 2016 - 

There is a new podcast in town (or rather… on the Internet) and it’s called CONVERSATIONS WITH FUNNY FEMINISTS, created and hosted by funny woman Pam Victor, co-author of “Improvisation at the Speed of Life: The TJ &amp; Dave Book.”

In this monthly podcast, Pam Victor geeks out with well-known funny feminists about the state of women in comedy with a focus on providing practical tips for comedians. Created in reaction to the recent sexual harassment scandals that have surfaced in major improv and scripted theaters in Chicago and LA, CONVERSATION WITH FUNNY FEMINISTS keeps the discussion going in an effort to provide opportunities for healing, growth, and the evolution of the treatment of women in comedy. This podcasts talks to big-name improv and scripted comedians to help women in comedy figure out how to best navigate the comedy world as well as how to face unfortunate issues as they arise: What do you do when a teacher you respect is treating you like his precious pet prodigy? What do you do when a superstar in the improv world texts you an inappropriate photo? What do you do when you’re at a party and the guy who casts shows at your theater comes onto you? What do you do when immature fellow performers trap you in a scene you’re uncomfortable with? These situations are all too common in the comedy world. CONVERSATION WITH FUNNY FEMINISTS adds air and intelligence to these issues with an aim to provide useful tools that comedians can employ at their next rehearsal, class, or show. Oh, and there is a lot of laughter too!

The first episode is being released and features improv guru Susan Messing (iO, Annoyance and Second City Theaters.) Upcoming funny feminist guests include Stephnie Weir (MadTV and Lady Dynamite); Rachael Mason (Head of Advanced Improvisation at Second City/Chicago); Jill Bernard (Huge Theater and ComedySportz in Minneapolis); and Megan Gray (Artistic Director of Magnet Theater, NYC). And many, many more!

Pam Victor is the co-author of “Improvisation at the Speed of Life: The TJ &amp; Dave Book” along with legendary improvisers TJ Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi. She writes the popular blog interview series “The Zen of Improv” and “Geeking Out with…” and gets into toasty tête-à-têtes with headliners at improv comedy festivals in “Geeking Out with: The Live Talk Show.” A nationally-touring improv teacher, Pam Victor is the founder and president of Happier Valley Comedy (Western Massachusetts) where she designed and runs a full, multi-level improv school, produces improv shows, and facilitates corporate development workshops.

improv,"I have been doing improv for the last 6 months or so. Initially twice a week, now its once a week, and am going to start doing it twice a week again.

The reason for me getting started in improv, is not because I want to become an improv star, but to improve my communication skills. Though if I become mini-star that would be great too..

During my last long form improv class, level C, I started hitting some walls. I found I am not as good a listener as I thought, also I had a hard time creating new scenes. 

It maybe due to a lot of reasons. Partially because my mother tongue is not english (though I am fluent in english), because of almost non-existent life experiences to draw scenes from (I was very very introverted, hide-in-my-room-all-day introvert for over 28 years), because I am also a poor listener, and have some anxiety issues. I am not shy atleast not now.

What I saw was that I would create scenes which were based on conflict a lot, and even though our instructor told us not to go there I would repeatedly go there. As a result I wouldnt be able to sustain a scene for a long period of time. i would usually get a huge laughter due to something random I would create, but others would be better at adding details to the scene, storytelling etc. 

I am thinking that even though I struggeled, this is actually a good opportunity for growth. So I am going to keep doing improv, and invest more into it. 

The last level (Level D) that I am going into in our school is a short form improv, and after that we will have another performance.

I find characters that are confused/overwhelmed extremely funny and I constantly have ideas of ways to overload the straight man with things to react to instead of building on the crazy character's game. 

Ex: Crazy1 tries to return a sandwich to a blockbuster instead of a movie to the cashier. I could come out as Crazy2 and ask to return a gun instead of Die Hard, OR I enter as the manager needing to do a performance review while the cashier is dealing with Crazy1. The manager giving disappointed remarks when the cashier won't make the customer happy and return the sandwich is way funnier to me than being Crazy2 which ""heightens the game"" according to class. 

I also think randomness is hilarious and one time a word association had Vietnam and Care Bears mentioned. 2 soldiers were doing a scene and were scared so I wanted to enter as the enemy Care Bear. It wasn't heightening or connected to anything, but I thought it would be fun to play (I didn't because of the previously stated fear).

I've found that I can occasionally hold a halfway decent conversation with two different characters whilst in the car as I prepare for the game, but when I get in front of my friends, I have a difficult time coming up with things to say.

The new added twist I've noticed is this: That statement is now followed up by ""I want to be female.""

Hoo boy. While I understand that a player may believe *this* is an acceptable *heightening* of their thing, I would challenge their notion that *dance is inherently feminine,* or that *being feminine is exclusively for women.* Compounded with the fact that this player is utilizing trans experience in such a glib manner, it all reads as a hack punchline.

3.  They each monologued a story of how the mom got pregnant, but both at the same time.  They talked over each other, but in a clever way where they kept passing focus between each other.

It was amazing because they had to listen to the other and incorporate it into their own story almost instantly, so it was perfectly consistent.

* Yes, anding (borrowing from Jason Shotts the idea of learning to say yes, before and)

Any thoughts would be hugely appreciated :)","When you started improv, what were some of your favourite exercises?"
improv,"I'm a Level 4 student who's been studying improv for a year now. I've always struggle with initiations, something I made both my Level 2 and 3 teacher aware of. But it finally took my Level 4 teacher spelling it out to me how to do it.

What my teacher said to do is find a word from the opener. Then A-to-B it (what does that word make you think of?) Now with that new word how does that word relate to your life? Do you have a story with that new word? An emotional response? 

A few of the examples we came up with in class tonight were:

I picked out the word economy. From that I thought of the word poor. Poor makes me think of how I've never had to deal with money issues and can just ask my dad for money. So my teacher and I did a practice scene about me taking advantage of my father. 

There was the word brick. My teacher noted that's a Ben Fold's song. I told him Ben Fold's once wrote a song about a squirrel killing himself. So my teacher said, ""Dad! You know that squirrel in the backyard. He's got a rope tied around his neck.""

Later I heard the word frostbite. Which made me think of amputation. And that made me think how I'm a hypochondriac who always thinks the worst when I get hurt, like I'm going to lose my arm. So I wind up doing a scene where I endow my scene partner with a papercut and tell him he's overreacting. 

This type of brain storm probably works best for word specific openers, such as the pattern game or invocation (we were actually doing them when I pointed out to my teacher I couldn't pull anything from it). I just thought I'd share since this is the first time pulling ideas from openers has ever seemed clear to me and some other students might be struggling with the same issue. 

For those of you who aren't struggling, how do you generate ideas for initiations?",I finally learned how to A-to-C initiations

Now of course I am no genius, I'm sure I have my fair share of gaffs and bad scenes, but some classmates just don't seem to understand the concepts we're doing, or are the literal ""what-not-to-do"" person who says ""you're not hurt, you're just pretending again,"" and other classic scene-killing lines. 

There's various reasons as to why I think this is happening -- the class meets at a weird time and not at a set schedule, so people don't really chat or get social afterwards.. some of the class knows each other so they're a little clique-y and set apart from the rest; we've had a lot of absences as well.

Long time listener, first time poster.

I'm an improviser from Sydney, Australia, and I'm going to be coming to Chicago and New York this July/August. I'll be taking the iO Chicago Summer Intensive for 5 weeks in July/beginning of August, and then I'll be in New York from the 12th till the 21st, after which I fly back.

While I'm pretty much set for what to do in Chicago (and 5 weeks is plenty of time to explore, find places to jam and play, etc), since I'm only spending 9 days in New York, I'd love to know of any jams or workshops or week-long intensives or drop-in classes that I could conceivably do while I'm there.

I know UCB have their 101 intensive starting on the 15th which is one option, although I'm a bit concerned that 101 might be a bit too foundational (and I've heard it tends to very much be actors/people looking for a resume boost). I can theoretically do 201 (spoke to UCB about it since I would have completed the iO intensive by then) but thats a two week intensive and I have to leave on the 21st and return to reality.

What other options are there? I know Magnet offers week-long intensives, are they any good (especially compared to UCB)? Also know that PIT offers drop-in classes, which I’ll look into as well. Are there other theatres I should be looking at? Or maybe open jams with existing troupes?
I'd love some advice on how best I should use my time there, don't want to waste a second!

Our first alternate choice was Seattle or Portland, but there doesn't seem to be much of an improv scene there. There seems to be some short form, but we're very much longform performers.

I have High Functioning Autism/Asperger's Syndrome. While I don't have much luck with dating, I did meet some interesting people by being involved in some group hobbies, namely board games and improvised theatre.

The great part of getting the activity groups is that you can interact with people in a well defined setting. I will talk more about improv.

Or meetings consist of our teacher giving us some hints, then doing some warm up games, and then playing some scenes. It is liberating to know that

1. This is a small and friendly group, if I do something wrong, our teacher will give me immediate feedback to correct it.
1. While acting, I don't have to do any social interactions, just play the game
2. While playing, you can't mess up. If you say something stupid or inappropriate, it's funny, people laugh.
1. I have things to talk about as we have something in common.

This controlled environment helped me to expand my comfort zone and actually started making friends. Eventually, I started leading the group for a few months and produced my very own show for stage. It happened step by step.

I would say my importing group is probably why I'm not coming up with elaborate and failsafe plans for killing myself while leaving instructions to my family to access my bank accounts and belongings etc.

Do you find that in the upper levels everyone is on the same skill level?  Do you feel challenged in each class you took and how where your classmates?

I ask because the very first theater I took improv classes at warned people that they have to be invited into the following level and that it was hard to get through all four of their levels without being asked to repeat one.  I was totally fine with this, but it felt like everyone just got invited back, even if they didn't seem ready.  I remember being in level 3 with a guy who would start every scene by shrugging, looking at the teacher, and saying ""I don't know what to do.""  I liked the school and the theater, but sometimes I didn't feel challenged by my other classmates, and it was frustrating to be pulled down or to have a scene stalled in a more advanced class.

I was put on the High school B-Team this year, and I am hoping to make the A-Team next year.  There is going to be one open spot next year due to graduation.  The competition for that spot is going to be very close, there are probably about 5 contenders in the B-Team that could get in, myself included.  Most people on the A-Team are gr11-12, whereas the B-Team is primarily gr9-10.  I like everyone on the B-Team, but I relate more to the A-Team.

The A-Team is a top contender at regional competitions, placing 2nd 3 years in a row.  The B-Team is less competitive, placing around 20th out of 30ish this past year.  The B-Team is funny and entertaining, but doesn't have the substance to compete competitively.

improv,"I'm part of a large troupe (about 10 of us) that's trying to break into long form.  Does anybody have any good ideas for formats that will allow everybody to make a meaningful contribution?  I'd rather not see some players basically sidelined or forced to be random hobos and trees and stuff because all the ""important character"" slots were taken.

We're planning to brainstorm formats that will target this problem in particular, and I'm wondering what the community at large has seen done for this kind of situation so I can bring that to the table.

improv,"What questions did you have or what advice did you seek when you first got into improv? Did you get answers or the advice you were looking for? Were they helpful? And what questions do you STILL have now that you've been doing it for a while?

I'm doing research for a project and would like to know about your questions and answers.

Thanks!",What advice did you seek when you first discovered improv?
improv,"This might be an incredibly stupid question, but... what is the best way to approach someone about coaching your practice group? I read somewhere that asking by text is rude, so is it also rude to contact by FB message (which I already did–GO BLIND INITIATIVE!). Should I go see someone's show and then approach them afterwards? Go to a drop-in class and ask afterwards?

Also, do I have to know the coach? There are people in my group suggesting coaches I haven't talked to before. I trust their opinion, however, should I ask them to reach out to the coach instead, even though I'm mainly the one organizing everything?

Anything else I should avoid or I should ask during this process? Sorry if this is a silly question. This is my first practice group. I'm not even sure what we should focus on (most of the group is from my class–we just finished learning the basic Harold).",Ettiquette for Contacting a Coach?
improv,"Susan Messing is right. Fun really does seem like a more important goal than ""funny."" I actually get bored watching improv shows when it seems that the team is more focused on funniness or ""being clever"" than when they are just having genuine fun with each other.

Do you think having fun on-stage, connecting with your scene partners, and reacting honestly ever DOESN'T lead to playing in or watching an enjoyable improv set? 

I want to know what makes the difference between a team you enjoy watching anytime versus a team that's impressive in some moments, but not necessary for you to see ever again...a team you're just not that interested in watching. Sure, you admire their moves and scene-work, but do you actually care? I usually don't. People having fun and connecting is just so damn FUN to watch. 

Everyone plays differently, and I know that learning the structure of the game and having a deal and POV can be very helpful. And yet I'm still in my head about them. Fun seems like a simpler goal to pursue than ""good scene-work""  and I just wonder if somehow the ability to tap into that can short-circuit years of training and classes where getting in your head prevents you from actually ENJOYING your improv.

I'm curious about your thoughts on this.

Not pretending to be wise, 'cause I'm not. More so for myself as I'm constantly looking to simplify. ",FUN versus FUNNY
improv,"I have absolutely zero experience. The only experience I have performing in anything is dance and even that I haven't done in years. I'm quite shy and introverted and thinking that maybe taking an improv class might help me in this department.

Someone said to me once, ""You're really funny, but not confident. Speak up a bit."" I think improv might help me with this too. 

Is it ok to take an intro class if I have absolutely zero experience? ",Total beginner...what to expect?

improv,"I’ll bet we all did something improv-y before we did Improv. Like, when I was in 4th grade I auditioned for the school play. Well, I didn't realize we were supposed to have two audition pieces - a second one for a callback - so when I was asked to give my second piece I made up a monolog on the spot about littering based on seeing a cupcake wrapper someone had left on the floor.

Years later I learned that what I did was improv, but as far as 4th Grade Me was concerned I invented it. When did you ""invent"" improv?","When did you ""invent"" improv?"

improv,"Hi! Was sent here from /r/comedywriting. 

I was recently given a 2 hour radio show (3-5AM, ugh) and I'd love to get some weirdo, Tim and Eric style calls; possibly with recurring characters, during mic breaks after blocks of music. 

I can pre-record the calls, and can improv (poorly), and was hoping you might be able to provide some resources? Or perhaps help out? The show is on community radio, so I can't really offer much in compensation (shitty, I know. Sorry). Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated!

To kind of set the tone of the direction– my friend and I were thinking about having one character that calls in every show asking for directions to the Hard Rock Cafe in a different town each episode. Just ridiculous stuff in the vein of [Longmont Potion Castle](https://youtu.be/Mb3pVTdOd7I) or characters like [Bob Ducca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMIBQuLlXI) from Comedy Bang Bang. 

 Thanks!!

improv,"Hey, so me and some friends from my improv classes are planning on booking space to practice/rehearse and book some stage time with the goal being to audition for spots on the more advanced levels of Second City and the local improv theatres in Toronto. 

We're 6 people who have been taking classes and range from me who's been doing it for half a year or for years since high school. 

During our practice sessions we're planning on learning/doing a new format every week or two and then doing that at a spot. We plan to record the sessions so we can do some review as well. 

The plan is to get deeper into the scene and learn more about the different types of formats, with an emphasis on more longform/narrative stuff.
