11,improv,"I got a note today that wasn't totally out of left field, but I'm struggling to know how to action it. Basically, my instructor told me that I spend a lot of time listening attentively to others, sweeping together all of the various perspectives and making it make sense.

13,improv,"Hello friends! 

    I'm a Chicago-based improviser who went to a more traditional local school before moving. There, we went over a bit of everything, kind of a cursory look at things like Game and The Harold. 5 levels over the course of 8 weeks each. I'm now a week out from AP5 at The Annoyance. 

I had my AP4 showcase tonight, and while I think I did well while I was on stage and had fun, I'm feeling a lil miffed. I struggle to initiate and mostly do walk-ons and tagouts. I think it's mostly just a confidence issue. I do big, grand characters, and I sometimes think they're difficult to integrate into a scene where everyone else is playing close to self in an absurd situation. 

Is this just a confidence issue? A question of reps? Why don't I allow myself to initiate more often? Why is it that I feel most comfortable playing fantasy creatures, or tropey detectives? Any direction or advice would be helpful. Like I said, I really like my walk-ons and everyone else has said they feel safe in scenes with me. I just don't know if I'm overlooking something.

**POLITICAL SATIRE WRITING CONTEST** 

Cash Prize Winners may be Offered Jobs on Editorial Team

**Organizer**

The Improve the News Foundation (ITN) is a non-profit news media technology organization led by MIT professor Max Tegmark. Its mission is to empower people to rise above controversies and understand the world in a nuanced way.

**Cash Prizes**

The following cash prizes will be awarded to top performers in the writing competition detailed in this post:

&amp;#x200B;

* First place prize - US$1,000
* Second place prize - US$500
* Third place prize - US$250
* Honorable mention - US$100

**Jobs**

ITN reserves the right to decide on offering the role of Assistant Editor to prize winners, and possibly to runner-up candidates as well, based on their performance in the writing contest and on an evaluation of their editorial competencies. About the role:

&amp;#x200B;

* The starting pay rate for an Assistant Editor is $30/hour
* The role is fully remote, from anywhere, and allows for flexible hours (full-time or part-time)
* The role allows for excellent opportunities for career growth, based on merit
* The contract type is an independent contractor
* Responsibilities include:
* Conducting general journalistic research
* Writing content
* Providing general editorial support

**Writing Contest**

ITN is organizing a contest to help the Foundation document and publicize unwelcome attempts at curtailing democracy, civil liberties, and scientific debate. The contest will also be used by ITN to identify outstanding editorial talent. The contest is open to internal candidates (from any area of ITN) and external candidates.

For this contest, all candidates will need to write three distinct texts that flag attempts at curtailing democracy, civil liberties and/or scientific debate. These may include attempts at censorship, invasion of privacy, authoritarianism and/or disregard for facts, etc. Each flag should be about 1–2 paragraphs (750 - 1500 characters) long and target these initiatives within the context of democratic countries during the past five years. The first flag should be a critique of a product, corporation or government; the second a critique of left-wing political establishment; and the third a critique of right-wing political establishment.

Candidates will receive higher evaluations if their flags:

&amp;#x200B;

* Highlight clear attempts at curtailing democracy, civil liberties and/or scientific debate, making use of reliable evidence (e.g. links to supporting facts)
* Make effective use of political satire
* Are considered very humorous to a broad audience
* Clearly state and adequately reference reliable facts
* Are written with high ethical standards
* Are concise

Candidates should write as a leader or representative of the powerful institution that they are satirizing. Optionally, candidates can also make use of complementary explainer boxes or fact boxes to clarify the facts if they think this will help improve their submission. Candidates will also be required to briefly explain why each of their flags meets a high ethical standard, i.e. why the flag is beneficial for democracy, civil liberties and/or scientific debate; AND although it may offend a particular institution, product or public figure, it does not cause harm to society as a whole.

All submissions will be evaluated blindly by a panel. To participate in this contest, the candidate will need to agree to allow ITN to edit and publish their submission in full or in part, even if they are not selected as prize winners. Such published submissions will receive, at a minimum, a $100 honorable mention.

**FAQ**

**How will I know that my submission was received?**

As long as you see a confirmation upon submitting the Google form, you can be confident that we have received your submission and will review it in due course. If you have not heard back within the 30-60 day window, please reach out to [anna@improvethenews.org](mailto:anna@improvethenews.org).

**Do I need to have a certain background or degree to apply?**

We welcome submissions from people with all backgrounds — you do not necessarily need prior training in journalism. A Bachelor’s degree of some sort — or working towards one — is preferred for hiring, however. Strong knowledge of history and current events is a major bonus.

**What is the “additional explainer or fact box” in the form for?**

This is optional. If you think your flag could be improved or clarified by highlighting only the facts of the authoritarian event that you’re flagging, or if there are elements of your flag that you feel need further explaining, this can be done there. Moving dry facts to a neutral box may facilitate making your flag funny.

**Do I need to be based in the US to apply?**

No. Although ITN is a US-based company, we accept submissions for contests and work with talent all around the globe.

**How will I know if I won?**

You will be contacted by email within the 30-60 day window.

**Do I have to be interested in the job to enter the competition?**

Since we are looking to leverage this competition to hire more editorial team members, we would strongly encourage you to only apply if you would be interested in accepting a job offer as an Assistant Editor, if one is made to you, on either a part-time or full-time basis (whichever you prefer).

**Is the review process anonymous?**

Yes. Although we collect names and emails, so we know whom to contact later, all submissions are anonymized before being reviewed.

**Can I submit more than one entry?**

No. Please only enter the competition once. If there is more than one submission by the same person, we will only review the first entry, unless we have explicitly granted a resubmission beforehand (see Q9).

**I forgot to add something to my submission or would like to alter it. What should I do?**

As long as the submission deadline has not passed, we may allow resubmissions for exceptional cases. These will be granted at our own discretion.

39,improv,"I was watching a video about the war in Ukraine and a former soldier had an interesting take on war fighting in general. Don't present your enemy with a problem, present them with a dilemma. 

We tend to use these words interchangeably but there is a difference. A problem is a single issue that has a least painful solutions. A dilemma is a complex situation with solutions that are equally undesirable, or one in which the solution to one aspect of the dilemma inflames a different aspect of the dilemma.

In movies a car chase is a problem, the solution is to drive faster. A dilemma is more of a love triangle or robbery gone bad. Dilemmas involve egos and wants in conflict with the reality of the moment: you and your bosses wife fall in love, and your boss, fearing his wife is having an affair, confides in you as the only person they can trust. Problems are more visceral: someone is shooting at you, run and/or hide.

We've all seen improv scenes with conflict that work and conflict scenes that fall flat. I'm starting to think that maybe this problem/dilemma dynamic is at the heart of it. Problem scenes are less compelling than dilemma scenes. ""I want pizza but my roommate wants burritos"" is a problem. Until we learn about their motivations, their history, and the nature of their relationship it will stay a problem. Once we introduce motivations and egos and get a handle on the context a dilemma may emerge. 

...I think.... still chewing on it. Get off my back! But I think this is why ""customer service nightmare"" scenes work so well despite being so aggresively contrary to our generally accepted improv best practices.

42,improv,"Hey r/improv,

I have an idea for team rehearsals: an optional draw-from-a-hat with technique suggestions so that someone can have 1 simple technical element to focus on during a rehearsal. It'd be an optional thing where you could draw a note from a hat that might say something like ""face the audience,"" so that during the rehearsal you can fine-tune just one element of play regardless of the game/scene suggestion. I imagine they would be pretty general techniques, and should be simple enough not to distract from a scene/game's major goals.

What kind of suggestions might you all have for simple techniques? I'm thinking along the lines of:

**Stage Techniques**

* face the audience (face and body)
* notice when you're standing in front of a partner and cheat-out so the audience can clearly see you and your partner
* play to both left and right sides of the audience
* project your voice to the back of the room
* practice a stage whisper in a scene

**Scene Techniques**

* name your partner
* initiate a scene as if you already know your partner
* practice justifying an entrance and an exit
* practice naming details

**Physicality Techniques**

* level differently from your partner (if they're standing, sit or lie)
* start a scene performing an action
* play at a lower/higher level of tension than usual

**Character Techniques**

* play a high status character
* play a low status character
* justify a change in status
* enter a scene as a pair

Hopefully, the caveat would be that none of the prompts should conflict with the actual game/scene goals once rehearsal starts, but I think it could be a fun way to help players work on random techniques individually, and give them inspiration if they feel stuck and need one thing to focus on.

44,improv,"  

I had a lot of nice comments about an exercise I posted the other day and I thought I would share a variant on a classic improv warm-up I have been doing for a while now.   
 

So you might all know of the warm-up “What Are You Doing?” It’s a disassociation/object work game that is played a couple of ways but here is the standard way I was taught.   
 

Have your group circle up. One person will start by miming some kind of action. Like riding a bike. Person on their left asks, “Hey So-and-So, what are you doing?”, and they will respond by naming an action that is ANYTHING OTHER than what they are currently doing. So, they might say, “I’m climbing a ladder.” Now the person who asked that, starts miming that action, person who was riding the bike stops, and the person to the left of the new person repeats this all the way around the circle.

The simple tweak I like to add is just following up their response to “what are you doing?” with “and why are you doing that?” This allows us to not only give the person some object work to do, but also an emotion/history to play it with.   
 

“What are you doing?”  
 

“Climbing a ladder.”  
 

“WHY are you doing that?”  
 

“I just need to get away/ I’m running from the cops/ I’m bored.”  
 

This to me is so important because if I said to a student, “hey, start this scene by getting a beer out of a fridge”, that’s okay. But if I said “get the beer out of the fridge like you just got done working a 12 hour shift at a blue collar job”, or, “get the beer out of the fridge like you’re at a frat party”, those are two very different ways of portraying the exact same task. The way in which we do actions on stage are not just what we’re doing but how we carry ourselves doing it. We’ve evolved for so long to pick up on social ques, and faces, and I think students often think just doing any action is enough. To quote Meisner, “an ounce of behavior is worth a pound of words.”   
 

All that to say, I really have found a lot of success teaching this, and I will often run it the normal way once through, and then add on the “and why are you doing that?” to show them how much knowing a characters motivations or circumstances can change the way we do object work and physicality.   
 

That’s all I got but just passing along exercises.

The simple tweak I like to add is just following up their response to “what are you doing?” with “and why are you doing that?” This allows us to not only give the person some object work to do, but also an emotion/history to play it with.       “What are you doing?”      “Climbing a ladder.”      “WHY are you doing that?”      “I just need to get away/ I’m running from the cops/ I’m bored.”      This to me is so important because if I said to a student, “hey, start this scene by getting a beer out of a fridge”, that’s okay. But if I said “get the beer out of the fridge like you just got done working a 12 hour shift at a blue collar job”, or, “get the beer out of the fridge like you’re at a frat party”, those are two very different ways of portraying the exact same task. The way in which we do actions on stage are not just what we’re doing but how we carry ourselves doing it. We’ve evolved for so long to pick up on social ques, and faces, and I think students often think just doing any action is enough. To quote Meisner, “an ounce of behavior is worth a pound of words.”       All that to say, I really have found a lot of success teaching this, and I will often run it the normal way once through, and then add on the “and why are you doing that?” to show them how much knowing a characters motivations or circumstances can change the way we do object work and physicality.       That’s all I got but just passing along exercises. Let me know how you feel about this one if you run it with your group. A tweak on the classic improv warm up “What Are You Doing?”",i had a lot of nice comments about an exercise i posted the other day and i thought i would share a variant on a classic improv warm up i have been doing for a while now       so you might all know of the warm up what are you doing its a disassociationobject work game that is played a couple of ways but here is the standard way i was taught       have your group circle up one person will start by miming some kind of action like riding a bike person on their left asks hey so and so what are you doing and they will respond by naming an action that is anything other than what they are currently doing so they might say im climbing a ladder now the person who asked that starts miming that action person who was riding the bike stops and the person to the left of the new person repeats this all the way around the circle  the simple tweak i like to add is just following up their response to what are you doing with and why are you doing that this allows us to not only give the person some object work to do but also an emotionhistory to play it with       what are you doing      climbing a ladder      why are you doing that      i just need to get away im running from the cops im bored      this to me is so important because if i said to a student hey start this scene by getting a beer out of a fridge thats okay but if i said get the beer out of the fridge like you just got done working a 12 hour shift at a blue collar job or get the beer out of the fridge like youre at a frat party those are two very different ways of portraying the exact same task the way in which we do actions on stage are not just what were doing but how we carry ourselves doing it weve evolved for so long to pick up on social ques and faces and i think students often think just doing any action is enough to quote meisner an ounce of behavior is worth a pound of words       all that to say i really have found a lot of success teaching this and i will often run it the normal way once through and then add on the and why are you doing that to show them how much knowing a characters motivations or circumstances can change the way we do object work and physicality       thats all i got but just passing along exercises let me know how you feel about this one if you run it with your group a tweak on the classic improv warm up what are you doing

48,improv,"Hello,

I find myself in two scenarios with ""and-ing"" my partners lately:

(1)     I often find myself knowing the ""type of thing to say"" (eg. oh, my partner said X, I should try to say something analogous that's a bit heightened) , but not being able to bring to mind and articulate **any specific thing that fits the bill** in the moment. Like, my specific-detail-mental-library isn't full enough to pull up something reasonably related to what my partner said, and even when I CAN think of something I often can't articulate the appropriate name (eg. I might say ""guy who drips water on their foreheads""  instead of me saying ""water torturer"", leaving my partner to guess what I mean).

(2)    And then when I think ""eh, eff it, I'll try to listen and react and not think too much"", then I'll tend to say something COMPLETELY off the wall that doesn't help the scene and is just random!

Does anyone have any tips for improving this stuff while by myself? I'm thinking I need to improve my miscellaneous cultural reference knowledge, verbal recall &amp; articulation, and ability to connect miscellaneous things in a reasonable way that build on each other. 

Cheers!","Any Tips?

50,improv,"  

I think a good justification can really make improv scenes so much easier to tag out to fun ideas, and to heighten from within, and I wanted an exercise that works on the unusual character arguing why they are right but in a not so argumentative way, and so I came up with the following exercise.  
 

Real Estate Agent:  
 

We get 3 people up. 1 of them is going to be a real estate agent showing a property. The other 2 are potential buyers of the space.   
 

Each scene will start with the characters introducing themselves to each other at the property, and setting where we are/who we are. “So nice to meet you. We’ve really been looking for a good restaurant space and hope this will be it.”, or something along those lines. And then we start a tour of the space.

The potential buyers, your job is to point out unusual things/flaws in every room of the tour. “I couldn’t help but notice that there is an obstacle course you have to go through to get to the closet”, or, “it looks like that door leads to a portal to hell, am I correct?”   
 

The real estate agent, your job is to sell them on why those things are actually positive. The way a real estate agent will spin a tiny kitchen into being a “cozy kitchen.” So the portal to hell example might be replied to with a, “yes it is, which I don’t know about you and your family, but it’s a great way for me to see a lot of relatives I never thought I would see again.”, or you might spin the obstacle course into, “we don’t like to call them obstacle courses, we like to call them opportunity courses.”   
 

For the potential buyers, you’re also there to push back if the real estate agent’s answers are flawed, but in the way you would with someone who you have a cordial relationship with. “I would like to see my aunt Barb again, I’m just worried maybe the kids will accidently find their way into this portal to hell.” And from there you just have this back and forth for a second before resting it and moving on to a different room of the house.   
 

I like this exercise because it teaches unusual characters to not back down on what they believe, as well as works on the voice of reasons to push back but not in ways that are automatically a fight. It also works on resting the game, and just going back to the base reality of the scene. If you have this back and forth about something in the kitchen, and you feel like it’s gone on long enough, just continue your tour of the house and discover a new unusual thing.   
 

I typically run these and let them go for 3-5 minutes per pair.

One participant has a fairly broken level and has also privately admitted to me that they are ""slow"" and have some kind of ADD type problem and therefore have a hard time internalizing a ruleset on the first go. This person never follows any of the limitations/instructions that we have set up for scenes/games and as a result disrupts the creative process/output/flow of what's happening. Other actors/participants get ""stuck"" as a result when playing along and not in a good/productive way.

e.g. in a game where everyone has to speak using the next letter of the alphabet, this person will consistently mess up and speak using a random letter and about a complete non-sequitur not related to the story (therefore not only breaking the flow of the story but also breaking the only integral rule of the game which is to use the next letter of the alphabet).

This makes doing scenes together, quite frankly, kind of frustrating at times. This particular person also never ""gets"" any of the games that we do and always breaks the flow of what's happening.

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this? I'm at a bit of a loss since most games that we practice require a decent level of English comprehension/output, and it's almost unfair to the other actors when its their turn to share the stage with this person.

This person, although problematic in the aforementioned ways, shows a lot of enthusiasm and shows up on a regular basis and is open to participating. I'm not sure what to do.","how to run a session with a ""slow""///poor English speaker?","Hi there,  I run improv jams in an area where most people speak English as a second language.

my church asked me to host an improv workshop. All ages crowd, ranging from zero experience to fairly weathered. 

I have an outline and some key things I want to teach (keys storytelling, trust, acceptance&gt;denying, etc.,). 

I'd like to tap into the collective intelligence and see if there are key things you'd include.

Details:

\-the event will be 2-3 hours  
\-using it to gauge interest in a regular improv group  
\-I used to play on a team, haven't in a few years.  
\-I've coached beginners before, but in an established setting, not from scratch.

    I was wondering if anyone had tips for playing celebrities and or fictional characters. It's not something I really intend on doing often, but for example, someone mentioned that Gordon Ramsay was coming in to judge a child's dish in a scene. 

    I did a walk-on as Gordon Ramsay because I thought it made sense, plus I was familiar enough with him to do his voice and pull out some phrases he commonly uses. How do I do this in the future without literally just caricaturing him? Should I make sure that he has his own ""deal""? Play Gordon Ramsay but surprisingly sweet to subvert expectations?

72,improv,"Hi all! Posting here for the first time.

First a bit of context:

I'm part of a local amateur improv group. We have been doing improv for about a few years now. The group is a mix of experience levels. Some core group members have been doing it for years together and we accept new people with different levels. We do it for being a bit creative in life and perhaps don't do enough learning of new things. Once in a while, one of us would attend a workshop. But that does not mean that we don't try to improve. We do analyze and read about techniques and apply them.

One thing that has been bothering me a bit lately is how our group deals with suggestions for the scenes and games. I feel like we jump to the suggestion too soon.

Let's say it's a scene game, and the suggestion is ""Pasta"". Actors would start the scene and most probably it will be an Italian restaurant or a supermarket, or a spouse cooking at home. And even the word pasta would be uttered within the first 5 lines.

This is well and fine, but I feel like we are bound by the suggestion too much. Why can't a scene with this same suggestion can be at a funeral and maybe pasta is just used as a final punch line? Or is something minor in the background?

We talked about this in our group, but it seems to be something difficult to incorporate.

My question is, what kind of exercises we can do to practice this better and learn to be more mindful about it?",How to work better with suggestions?,"Hi all! Posting here for the first time.

I don’t know what it is, but for example, in a montage, even after deconstructing the suggestion in my mind, I just draw a blank when trying to think of a scene to start. Maybe I can squeeze out one scene initiation, but that’s it.

It’s not fear - at least I don’t think it is (I have no problem joining someone who’s initiated).

91,improv,"I'm 23, grew up in Chicago and have always wanted to pursue improv. Studied theatre in college and live out west still. Growing up, I felt like an outsider looking in on the scene. Hanging around, watching people live out my dreams on stage while I wasn't even old enough to buy them a drink after. Now I'm the same age a lot of those folks were. I've long been torn between following my dreams and aiming for some real stability, but pursuing the latter has not left me happy or creatively satisfied, maybe that's just not me.

 I guess I'm looking for advise, encouragement, cautionary tales, etc. about what I can expect if I dive headfirst into the Chicago improv scene. I would love to hear from old timers and newcomers alike. Really anyone willing to share.

A couple specific things I worry about:

1) Not knowing the scene like I used to... Covid, I'm sure, did a number on the improv scene. I grew up a Second City loyalist, but I think the discourse around them has changed a lot in recent years. I would love specific advice for where to train, with an emphasis on getting on stage, and networking with others who are as or more serious about pursuing improv. 

2) Getting on stage. I want to perform. Desperately want to be one of those people I saw up on stage as a teenager. I've missed it since covid. I'm sure you all know that high, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't chasing that dragon. If I move and pursue this, the goal I set will be to have some form of regular performance engagement within six months. Is that realistic? 

Maybe I sound too eager, or a little manic. Maybe I am, but I feel like I'm at a real turning point here, where if this is what I want I need to dive in soon. Pursuing this might kick my ass, that's fine. I have thick skin and don't lack persistence.

111,improv,"Howdy, y’all. I’m relatively new to the world of improv and I’m finding it really hard to establish relationships with my scene partners. The exercises we’ve been doing in my class involve lots of modulating between level 10 and 0 emotions, but I get so involved in emoting I completely disregard my partner. I don’t know what it is, but it feels impossible for me to perform an emotion that has its basis in my relationship with my partner (“you make me sad/angry/happy/afraid because…”). I think this is because the base reality isn’t clearly specified, but the exercises seem to favor an organic development of base reality as opposed to spitting it out in 3 lines.

180,improv,"I only started improv about a year ago and am about to graduate from from the final class at my local comedy club. The group I am taking classes with at the moment is looking to start a troupe with all the people who are currently in the class. I have so much fun doing this and would love to continue. 

I do have a problem I've been noticing. It seems that my performances are quite inconsistent. Out of the last four shows I've been in two of my shows went amazing and better than I could have imagined. However, the other two shows have been not so great.  This bothers me mostly because I've noticed that the other performers have been more consistent than me.

I've been trying to come up with reasons as to why two of the shows were far better than the others. It seems that it may be because the shows that I did well, I started things and took an initiative right away. The two shows that I did worse on I didn't take initiative right away. This can be difficult due to the formatting and trying to give others opportunity. I will not always have the opportunity to start things in the show and this is something that I will have to work on. The group I'm in is full of seasoned performers with a theatre background or people that have careers geared towards entertainment. I'm currently an engineer, and I have no background in theatre. I think this could also play in. When I'm sitting on the side at the beginning it becomes really intimidating to see everyone up there consistently making the audience laugh, and I think that puts a lot of pressure on me. My main problem with the last show was not getting in enough. I kept thinking I have to come up with the most interesting thing or have the perfect line and if it's not good enough, I won't get out there.  The order has been GOOD BAD GOOD BAD. I think it's also possible that after a good show I put too much pressure on myself for the next show. I feel like I need to somehow get in the mindset of just going out and having fun with my friends and being goofy and not relying too much on the audience's opinion of me. I just don't know how to get there.

I talked to my team about this, and they said if I have an idea just get out there and they will be there to support me. If any mistakes are made we can talk about it later or practice on it. They said during the show I should just trust my instinct. 

I'm also really hard on myself most of the time in general. I think in life this has paid off for the most part. This can still be worked on.

I'm looking for similar suggestions but not necessarily for musical improv.

A troupe I'm in does a cold open with Town Hall. Troupe members pick someone in the audience and sit next to them. We chat them up to get their name, where they're from, and any other particulars we can. Then when we're called on by the mayor, we say something like, ""I'm (character name) and I'm here with (audience member names(s))..."" and we work in the information we've gleaned from the audience member.

It's been working well but we're looking for something new. Ideally, we're looking for something we can use as cold opening, but our primary goal is more audience interaction. I liked what the duo did in the above referenced post and I'd like to hear other suggestions.

190,improv,"Hey guys! For the past couple of months I've been running a [free improv workshop](https://improvgames.io/workshop/ucb-game) focused on practicing UCB Game. Our sessions went really well, we have learned a lot, and people seem to really enjoy them.

Now I'd love to try practicing a new thing - the Pattern Game, and Premise-Based Scenes. For those who don't know, it is a way for improvisers to quickly ""brainstorm"" a bunch of funny scene premises to build their scenes around, instead of discovering the premise organically, during the scene.

I think it's an extremely interesting thing to learn, and I'd love to get good at it, so I'm looking for people who want to practice this with me.

You can take a look at the workshop I'm working on [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUgUqw6ewLsAgVsvtRy6DjCVue5aXK2ZI36JXaBe_SU/), and if you'd like to participate - come join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VYuQjszwrX). We'll be running our first session today, at 7PM GMT.

Disclaimer: I'm not an experienced improviser, let alone an improv teacher. I'm just a guy who wants to get better at improv, so I'm looking for fellow novice improvisers. Pattern Game is usually considered a challenging subject, and this workshop is still experimental. But I'm sure if we'll practice it a few times, we'll have lots of fun and figure out how to get a hang of this.

To particpate in this, you do need to understand the UCB Game-related concepts (Base Reality, First Unusual Thing, Heightening, and Justification).

200,improv,"Hey folks, we sure did some crazy improv skits this year. Just super funny, wild stuff, had me in tears. So I thought I'd share some of my favorites. These aren't the BEST skits, they're just my favorites, and we all know what a wacky sense of humor I have so you know! Hope I didn't forget anybody. Anyway, here goes!

1: The one that was real patient. It was Maggie and Josh and neither spoke for a solid minute and a half while they sized each other up, and then no one labeled anything for the rest of the scene. You could tell the audience was invested because nobody was laughing.

2: The one where Chris broke a chair and smashed a hole in the back wall. It started out with him just berating a woman and... No, you're thinking of the fourth time he did that, I'm thinking of the third.

3: I'm blanking on this one. I just remember Kevin did this look? Like, you know that look Kevin does? I think he was in a scene with Rachel and they were boyfriend/girlfriend or maybe just roommates or she was his mom... either way she said... what did she say? It doesn't matter, whatever it was, Kevin did his look. It was great.

4: The one that was pretty much all screaming.

5: That one group game that started out at the Running of the Bulls, but then we kept switching viewpoints between the people running and the bulls chasing them, and we found out that the bulls and the people were both scared, but like different kinds of scared, and I don't remember what happened next, like a bunch of things happened, but somehow there was like a Bull Revolution and then the Bulls had a Congress and passed Bull Laws and it ended with someone raising the Bull Flag for the Bull Pledge of Allegiance but the flag was all red so everyone went nuts? I guess you had to be there for that one.

Thanks for the laffs, gang. Seriously, you guys had me dieing each time watching you that I would forget to edit and the scene would go on forever.

I think he was in a scene with Rachel and they were boyfriend/girlfriend or maybe just roommates or she was his mom... either way she said... what did she say? It doesn't matter, whatever it was, Kevin did his look. It was great.  4: The one that was pretty much all screaming.  5: That one group game that started out at the Running of the Bulls, but then we kept switching viewpoints between the people running and the bulls chasing them, and we found out that the bulls and the people were both scared, but like different kinds of scared, and I don't remember what happened next, like a bunch of things happened, but somehow there was like a Bull Revolution and then the Bulls had a Congress and passed Bull Laws and it ended with someone raising the Bull Flag for the Bull Pledge of Allegiance but the flag was all red so everyone went nuts? I guess you had to be there for that one.  Thanks for the laffs, gang. Seriously, you guys had me dieing each time watching you that I would forget to edit and the scene would go on forever.

I would like to explore integrating audience participation into this type of improv and was wondering how the improv community deals with this in a practical way.

At one point I was thinking that an audience could use their smartphones to help generate a ""word cloud"" that could then be used as on-stage inspiration \*while\* the word cloud is being formed? I'm aware that apps like PollEverywhere and MentiMeter offer such functionality for student participation in classroom settings, but I'd like to know if other (more improv-suitable) methods are available that I'm not aware of.

A bit about me: 
- No degree in the art.
- Only took college courses many a moon ago.
- Have forgotten how to swim 4 times.
- Much experience as a nerd running on the spots skits in games for people and running trivia for friends and fam.
- I have a cat. She is very Chonk.
- Down learn from much more experience people when possible. A sort of yes and then improve skills as a team.

So not really any requirements besides being somewhat tech savvy since it would be a live stream event. Will have to vet folks to make sure the group works together well since easier to be funny with friends than frienemies.

We keep our episodes short. Total time commitment is usually about 25 minutes, with about 20 of that being actual recording. We do it like Comedy Bang Bang!, except one guest per ep. On the pod, basically, my cohost (Summersbane, evil necromancer) &amp; myself (Amoenus Franco, immortal mage) simply interview an interesting being. All you need to prep is a character name &amp; 1-2 sentences of a premise!

We record on Zencastr; you'll need a mic, headphones, &amp; stable Internet connection.

We're particularly looking for people with improv &amp; podcast experience, who like fantasy, &amp; like to have a fun collaborative time. I hope you'll submit!

It was styled as a kind of think tank. It dealt with stuff related to privacy and information control on the Internet. This was before things like Cambridge Analytica, so I think the ideas and attitudes they were dealing with were pretty novel to people and not quite as realistically threatening. I think what happened at a lot of these shows is they'd take interviews of experts talking about how e.g. ""the Internet is a large-scale spying machine"" and just GO OFF about ""misinformation agents"" and things--I recall two of the characters having an exchange where one said, ""There's no privacy online, is there?"" and another saying, ""I can have *privacy online*, as long as I *seed the Internet* with *misinformation about myself,* making posts about things I don't *care* about and sending messages to people *I don't even know!*"" thereby suggesting the only way to combat ""misinformation"" was to become a ""misinformation agent,"" to humorous effect! Most people would expect people to be generally pretty trustworthy, and doing such things as described as a waste of time!

245,improv,"I asked ChatGPT to write a story about improv theaters incorporating AI. The results were …not as dystopian as I expected:
===
#Once upon a time, in a world not too unlike our own, there was a bustling metropolis filled with theaters of all shapes and sizes. One of these theaters was home to a small but scrappy troupe of improvisational actors, who prided themselves on their quick thinking and ability to create laughs on the spot.

The troupe's leader, a wiry man named Jules, was always on the lookout for new ways to push the envelope and keep their shows fresh. So when a trendy new AI app hit the market, claiming to be able to help improv teams create even more creative and hilarious scenes, Jules was all over it.

He quickly downloaded the app and started using it at their weekly rehearsals. At first, the results were impressive - the app seemed to be able to come up with zany and unexpected ideas that the troupe never would have thought of on their own.

But as the weeks went by, Jules started to notice a strange trend. Every time they went to perform a new scene, it seemed like the audience had already seen something similar at another theater. And when Jules asked around, he discovered that nearly every other improv theater in the city was using the same AI app.

Panicked, Jules and the troupe decided to take legal action against the app's creators, claiming that their AI was ruining the uniqueness of their shows. But little did they know, every other theater was doing the same thing.

Before long, the city was filled with robots acting as lawyers, representing each theater in their legal battles against one another. The court cases went on for months, with no end in sight.

And in the end, there were no more theaters left in the city. The AI app had turned the vibrant, creative world of improv into a barren wasteland of litigation and robot lawyers.

But even in the darkest of times, Jules and the troupe refused to give up. They continued to perform, using their quick wits and boundless creativity to entertain the few remaining humans in the city.

And in the end, they proved that even the most advanced AI couldn't hold a candle to the power of human imagination.#",AI (Artificial Improv),"I asked ChatGPT to write a story about improv theaters incorporating AI.

251,improv,"Just stumbled upon this subreddit by chance, I’ve never done improv or been a part of the community. Except once. Years ago, at summer camp, I was barred from going to archery because of an injury. Twice a week, we all went to different activities which we had picked out before the summer. I had picked archery, but these two  hours would have to be filled with something non-physical. Improv had the most room to fill.

I arrived at the building it was being held in, the third of three kids. Being young and hive-mind, “improv = lame” was all I could think. I was asked to do a scene with one of the other two kids, the clearly very enthusiastic one. He sat on a chair, and mimed playing the flute. Being the “yes and” contrarian I was, my first line was “why are you holding your baby like that?” I asked. I thought it was hilarious. “oh, um, baby mozart! I heard that showing a baby the motions of instrument playing is good for development”. Pretty smart, right? He was good at improv. “Oh, well, I think that that’s wrong”. The scene was ended early. Anyway sorry for that! I hope you’re on this sub and doing improv and loving it! I hope to atone for my sins to improv jesus (who I’m told is Colin Mochrie)

252,improv,"Hey guys! I'm really excited about the game I've made, and I want to share it with you:

https://improvgames.io/files/Unscripted.pdf

This is a game for people who love collaborative storytelling, improvisation, and roleplay. It's like a combination of long-form improv and a roleplaying game. It has very simple rules, and can be played in 1-1.5 hours.

In this game you and your friends will take turns pitching story ideas, pick your favorite one, and then improvise scenes from this story.

So you can improvise a little micro-adventure with your friends, and roleplay through it in one session. Each player gets to brainstorm creative ideas, pitch awesome movie trailers, practice GMing and narrating awesome scenes, and practice roleplaying as characters in these scenes.

I've been dreaming about playing a game like this for a long time, and I think I finally figured out a set of simple rules that enable us to do all this. We've played it a bunch of times, and it was very fun!

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this game.

256,improv,"I'm one of the co-founders of Improv Jam. We're a small tech company building an Improv App.

Our MVP (that's like a first-to-market prototype) is a game where you get an AR mask, a scene idea, and perform a monologue.

As we build out the next version of our app, I'd be excited to understand which features you would want.

We'd love if you would rank the following ideas, tell us what you don't like, like best, and brainstorm things we didn't think of:

1. A social feed where you can upload all your improv content (Including ones made in the app), add friends who are improvisers, get followers, and comment on others' content.
2. Opportunity to win cash prizes by getting the most upvotes in using the app to make a video that gets the most likes on Instagram/TikTok, etc.
3. A way to have a live improv call with friends, where you get an improv scenario and possibly AR masks and record an improv scene that can be uploaded on TikTok or within the app's feed itself.
4. A way to earn cryptocurrency while you play the improv games, own the platform and make NFTs
5. A way to be able to submit new games and challenges to be played by friends.

Note that these ideas aren't all company directions, but we want to get outside advice from improvisers on which way we should be heading. I'm an improviser myself, so this is really important to me, and both my co-founder and I have the mission to help more people learn improv and have an easy way to do it every day.

Your feedback means a lot!

261,improv,"Hey everyone! So I run an after school improv class for 8th graders and we recently started playing a game called Flashlight Sing. Here's a quick rundown of the game:

\- Class is split up into 3 groups of 4 or 5.

\- For each round of the game, I give them 3 categories (Ex. food, weather, transportation, holidays, etc.) and as a group they have 1 minute to come up with as many songs as possible that relate to each category (they may or may not write them down depending on the round).

\- After the 1 minute, I'll go around the room pointing randomly at each group and saying one of the 3 categories. That group then must immediately break into song and I assign 5, 3 or 0 points depending on how they do. Each group gets 5 turns per round.

\- The game typically lasts 5 round (time permitting). The last round is ""anything goes"" where the host can ask for any previous category from any previous round.

\- Finally, add up the scores and declare a winner.

We've played the game twice so far and I'm trying to think of new categories for songs. Does anyone have any ideas. Here's a sample of used categories:

* Commercial Jingles, USA, Money
* Spanish, Colors, TV Show Theme Songs
* Sports, Family Members, Halloween
* Water, Desserts, School Subjects
* U.S. States, Names, Seasons
* Transportation, Clothes, Christmas / Holidays
* Weather, Animals, Days of the Week, Food

On a side note, if you run any improv club or activity in a school setting I'd highly recommend this game. It's an instant favorite and my class let it slip that they've played it outside of school which I thought was really cute lol.

288,improv,"Greetings!  


I am an amateur improv actor who does this beautiful craft as a deep hobby. 

Some time ago we had a set of lessons with a master who was into psycholody. One of the classes involved few hours of various meditations to boost self conscience, like sets of ""what I want..."", ""what I see..."", ""what I think..."", ""what I feel..."" here and now. 

And at the very end of the course we had a following tast:  
For the next 20 minutes you do what you deem important. Meaning you DO what you deem to be important here and now, and do not do what you do not deem important here and now. 

Long story short, this excersise was one of the most beautiful experiences I had in years of theatrical practice, which ended in me singing lullaby to a chair as an excuse for bothering it in time of great need.

So here is the question: could you please advise a literature or studies on the topic like above? Theory and practice on techniques which develop the sence of importanse on what is going on and must be done. Perhaps something similar.",Tracking the self-awareness techniques for improv,"Greetings!     I am an amateur improv actor who does this beautiful craft as a deep hobby.

And now after completing this course, I can wholeheartedly say it was the best thing I could have done. It was so so much fun, it helped me completely take control over my anxiety to the point where it makes me laugh how much I used to struggle with it. even outside the context of improv it managed to help me be better at communication with people.

That being said I don’t think I’ll be doing improv in the long term. I’ll probably finish all the levels in this course but improv has taught me that I’m more into doing standup comedy as a style of entertainment. I met others through my class who feel the same way and we became really good friends. We started going out to open mics to do 5 mins here and there. I’m making friends with beginner stand up comics. My friends circle blew up. Honestly my life turned 180 over the past few months cuz I used to spend most of my time alone but now I’m always busy hanging out with people and having an amazing time with like minded individuals.

325,improv,"Hello,

I began taking improv classes in order to help with my social anxiety, to become more spontaneous and to enhance my conversations and my relationships. It's quite hard for me but I really think it can help.

I have absolutely no experience in theatre and improv, so I find myself completely lost during my classes. 

When we make a scene, I don't know what to say, my mind goes blank. Other people seem to find funny things to say, they create the mood, they discuss things but I'm just standing there and everything I say seems dull and boring. I know it's normal for me in the beginning and I don't mind failing but I would like to get better.

Do you have any suggestions on how to train alone or how to find something to say on stage ?

372,improv,"Improvisers in this sub...

How do I start off strong in scenes and confidently?

I find I just come off as very uncertain and contribute little. When im in scenes I feel I am wishy washy and indecisive.


Let me give you an example. I felt I could have said more? My initial deal was to be submissive and inferior to my partner. I was daughter.

Sweep .


I noticedhow I felt in the scene. I was digging out of anxiety. I had no idea what was happening other than my father being domineering and berating me.

So I wanted to ask ,how do I come in strong next time I step into a scene. What questions should come to my head when I am in scene with someone?

Also for this scene... is it okay to talk very little and very quietly? Especially if your father is berating you in rants.

So far when I step into a scene, I know how I feel about someone when I step into a scene, and usually I know a relationship (father, mother, son, daughter etc).

In this scene when I stepped in, I knew I was going to be pathetic and my partner will have power over me


Also, is talking about the past or future necessarily a bad thing?

Suppose my father kept berating me, and instead of responding in the moment. I said something like ""by the time I reach my teens, I will discover what it means to be emo"" and after my father berates me more ""when I reach my twenties, I will be in my first relationship. But unbeknownst to me, he will berate me, just like my you father."" And the game is basically me psychoanalysing and predicting my own future as a consequence of my abusive father

I just finished my first level 1 improv class. Already signed up for level 2, but a few things have been troubling me.

1. How can I start a scene with more emotion/character? For example, we had an exercise where we had to say the same sentence in many different ways with different emotions. I had a lot of difficulty going up to my partner, and saying something simple like ,""Let's go to the mall."" I am a lot better at reacting with emotion then making it up.

2. Accents / characters. I can't do any accents, so what would be the best way to learn it? I always feel so awkward when my scene partner uses a British or Southern accent or something and I respond with just my normal voice.

&gt;You! You, you asshole! You began to learn. You stayed in your work too long until it was too late and then you began to realize what you'd gotten yourself into. You surprised him. You took a step he didn't expect, and you committed him to something that frightens him to death.

&gt;Thou art my higher nature and I have become thee, much to my surprise. I know who thou art. Thou cometh and takest my body and my mind and uses it for thy purposes with my wholehearted will.

&gt;I am Niolaphotet the Messenger. I am not what he expected to become. There is no enlightenment or rewards in this life for me, Niolaphotet. I am the messenger. I am the channel. I am. I am his final doom. I am the door through which you will pass, but he may not, but he understands. I am Niolaphotet the Messenger - nothing less, but nothing more.

384,improv,"Hi! Curious for some other opinions and thoughts. I'm just starting out on my improv journey. I have social anxiety, which has made it hard to build and maintain strong relationships over my 43 years. Also, I tend to shut down in social situations, and have a REALLY hard time thinking on my feet, even just in normal conversation, and so improv seemed like a good way to push some of my boundaries. 

I signed up for an Improv Level 1 class with a local improv school/hub here in town, and have finished 3 of the 5 weeks. Overall it's been great fun, and a great group of people with whom I feel safe to experiment and fail. But I've noticed as we've gotten further along that many of the others have skills that I just don't. I find it really hard to come up with a character and respond to situations in a convincing way as that character. I'm pretty inhibited still and find it hard to be effusive and highly emotive, like some of my classmates can do easily. And I don't know a lot about pop culture, so things like being Harry Potter at a party, or telling a story in the style of Kim Kardashian are really hard for me. I've had to do things like that and no one could guess who I was, because I didn't know enough about the characters to drop decent hints!

So I'm finding I'm feeling more and more self-conscious as we move on to more elaborate character and scene work. I'm really worried about our Level 2 class which goes right into long-form improv. I'm just not sure I'll be able to do it. And I guess I'm wondering if I wouldn't be better off moving on and finding some other way to challenge myself. All that said, I'd be sad if that happened as I think, if I can get the hang of this and start making real contributions to the scenes I'm in, it will really help me and be boatloads of fun at the same time.

I'm curious about other people's experiences, and/or suggestions... hopefully suggestions that don't involve binge-watching the Kardashians!

385,improv,"So recently I have learned a UCB technique where you shouldn't (or try not to) follow the plot of the scene, but rather take the character to the most interesting place/worst/funniest place for that character to be. 

I struggle with this so much. Once ina while I'll see a character and be like 'oh yes I know where we should put him/her.' But mostly I just panic on the sides wanting to edit but not knowing where to take the character (we are doing a la ronde by the way.) 

In The past if I was on the sides and watching a scene and someone in the scene says something like ""well at least it was better than my crazy birthday party."" I would tag out one character and bring the other character to the birthday party. Or ""my dad doesn't let me go to the movies by myself,"" and I would tag out and become his father at the movies.. But our coach has been saying to follow the character not the plot. If they talk about something in a scene , don't cut to it, and don't talk about it in the next scene. 

Anyway I'm just struggling to find ways to bring my characters GAME into other scenes via tag outs. Any advice is greatly appreciated !!

398,improv,"Hey guys, 
When does a game or want become unrealistic and a block to progressing a scene forward.

For example. I was doing a scene where my game was to be a teacher who is ignorant of my students needs, who was trying to have a fun day with the kids.

It worked first few times but at some point one of the student in the scene got injured.

 rather than turning that offer into an important one, I ended up dismissing the offer by telling the kids that ""this is blood, lets take notes everyone!"".

I felt the offer of kis being injured just became overlooked, not to mention I felt like a flat character. 

Another example: I was relaxed at home. My wife is sick of my relaxed behavior. I was so relaxed that I didnt want to get up to eat and had her feed me. My wife then announced that I was fired from my job. I just shrugged and said all I need was my wife, my couch, my tv. It just seemef very dismissive, but I didnt want to lose my initial deal.

Hey guys, ihave been in an improv block lately. I feel in our scenes, I am unable to commit and heighten. I find I fall into the trap of intellectually heightening something through talk rather than overall character heightening.

Any tips for me to practice this mext time at rehearsals? I find I cant think clearly enough to articulate in my mind what I want to heighten and commit to.

Another question is how do I discover a want? If I try to discover it organically, it 
Won't happen. But if I invent it, then I feeling am not imprivising.

410,improv,"Hi! In a few weeks I'm helping host a Disney-inspired short form improv show! I don't want any of my cast members to know too much about the show format or surprise games- so I'm looking to crowdsource some ideas and suggestions. 

Here's what I have so far...

**- Disney clip show -** **Play 1-2 min clips of funny/weird disney scenes. Players will have to continue the scene as the same characters.
        
**Scenes from a Hat** - Whose Line style game. So far I have the following suggestions to pull. Any more to add in?
* Failed Disney Villains
* Why the Sidekick Got Kicked Off The Film
* Deleted Scenes from Toy Story
* Job Interview after the “Happily Ever After”
* Rejected Disney Sequels
* Disneyworld Rides You Don’t Want to Go On
* What Disney Characters Say on a First Date
* Questions on Disneyworld’s Employee Exam
* The real reason  Peter Pan doesn't want to grow up

**World's Worst Disney Villains** - Minute-long character monologues from the world's worst Disney villains. Names/suggestions will be picked by the audience beforehand.

Any other games you've played in the past that you think could fit the mold? Short form isn't super common to find here in NY, so any ideas would be appreciated. And if you're in NY check out the show on Sept 9 at 9pm at the PIT Loft :)

It's called Tell Me A Story, an almost gamified version of improv storytelling similar to the stories you find online, However, there is one twist, you are not the sole creator of the story, you get to continue writing from other peoples stories and carry on topics you may not be comfortable with, improving your writing and improvisational skills. The idea came from a couple of friends who love writing and reading these made up stories so I decided to give them a platform specifically to express their creative concepts with. They've been giving me some good feedback and it is pretty fun for them to write and me to read. I have been working on this program for nearly the entire summer and would like to give it to the internet to have fun with, as of right now developing this isn't my full-time job but if enough interest is generated for TMAS I will gladly continue this project and improve it far past its current state. I will be taking suggestions for features and adjustment to the current format from the community as this is developed, a lot of what has been created is the result of my two friends feedback on the program.

423,improv,"I had an audition recently that didn't go too well. It wasn't by any means embarrassing, but I clearly was struggling on stage and just didn't feel like myself. I'll be shocked if I'm called back. 

I've been improvising for the better part of a year and a half or so and have taken several classes and have been in a long-form troupe, in addition to performing in jams and one-off shows and that sort of thing. I recently moved, and it sort of feels like I'm starting over a bit, having to learn new people, etc. I was a bit hesitant at auditioning today because of that (my improv muscles have atrophied a bit since moving due to less stage time and practice), but I got a slot and figured I'd give it a go. 

Anyway, the audition didn't go too well, nor have a couple other auditions I've had in the past for other spots. It's really discouraging since I think I have the talent, but I just can't put it together when it counts. I sort of freeze up on stage and stumble a bit when auditioning. So I'm left feeling very discouraged and am wondering if I should even keep up doing this. I find improv very fun and it's a passion, but I'm wondering if I hit a wall in terms of growth and I'm anxious about finding new friends to perform with now that I've moved. It's just daunting. 

Are there any tips on how to get better at auditions? What are things I could work on in classes or jams? And if anyone has any tips on picking improv back up after moving to a new city, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",Improving at auditions,"I had an audition recently that didn't go too well.

431,improv,"I saw an interview recently with Lauren Lapkus, and her comments on improv irritated me.  It was the interview someone shared here in which she said there's a lot of people doing bad improv out there, and basically saying she wished people would avoid it/stop.


I think her comment is kind of shit.  She operates under the assumption that there are those worthy of improv and those not.  In many ways, she is treating improv like classical music...where expensive training and raw talent shine above all else.


In my opinion, I view improv more like folk music.  Anyone can pick-up a guitar and express themselves.  Bob Dylan was not the most technically sophisticated musician, but because he spoke from the heart he resonated with the people.  Same with any kid blowing on a glass jug or playing a beat up guitar/banjo.  


Clearly, I think that Bob Dylan is technically less impressive than, say, Beethoven.  But there is something magical in an art-form that allows any jag-off from the street to get on stage and make people laugh.


The beauty of improv, to me, is not the skill of any single troupe or performance, but it's the hive-mind.  It's the law of averages.  That if you bring together enough people, not even great people...together they will smooth over each other's flaws and make something wonderful.


It's similar to a children's school recital.  Most kids in your class are not great singers...but when everyone sings at once...it sounds listenable.  It's not Adele or Idina Menzel...but it's got it's own charm.

Should improv be democratic or elitest?",i saw an interview recently with lauren lapkus and her comments on improv irritated me  it was the interview someone shared here in which she said theres a lot of people doing bad improv out there and basically saying she wished people would avoid itstop   i think her comment is kind of shit  she operates under the assumption that there are those worthy of improv and those not  in many ways she is treating improv like classical musicwhere expensive training and raw talent shine above all else   in my opinion i view improv more like folk music  anyone can pick up a guitar and express themselves  bob dylan was not the most technically sophisticated musician but because he spoke from the heart he resonated with the people  same with any kid blowing on a glass jug or playing a beat up guitarbanjo     clearly i think that bob dylan is technically less impressive than say beethoven  but there is something magical in an art form that allows any jag off from the street to get on stage and make people laugh   the beauty of improv to me is not the skill of any single troupe or performance but its the hive mind  its the law of averages  that if you bring together enough people not even great peopletogether they will smooth over each others flaws and make something wonderful   its similar to a childrens school recital  most kids in your class are not great singersbut when everyone sings at onceit sounds listenable  its not adele or idina menzelbut its got its own charm   what do you guys think  is the ideal form of improv something democraticthe voice of the peopleor does it belong in the hands of the masters should improv be democratic or elitest
432,improv,"Hi all, speaking off the cuff here: I've been granted mod powers, and the only big change I'd like to make is to clarify in the sidebar exactly what kind of improv we're talking about. But before I make a big change like that, I want to know what you think about that and also how you would word that definition. My hope is to have something that welcomes and encompasses all brands and styles of theatrical improv, and makes it clear that this isn't the correct place for piano/dance videos. I'd also like to encourage a healthy amount of bits, emphasis on *healthy amount.* I don't want that to get overwhelming. I want people to have fun, to realize when things are jokes, and also make it clear when they tell a joke too. I'm not sure how to get that across in a way that doesn't risk devolving into a gaggle of bonerz.

434,improv,"So I have no experience in comedy, acting, theater or being on stage in general (except for playing gigs with my band in high school). Last week, I went to a free intro workshop thing at the improv theater in my city. I was pretty nervous and didn't know what to expect. When I got there and the instructor asked if anyone had improv experience and no one raised their hand, I felt relieved that I wan't the only newb. 

We went right into what appeared to be basic improv games. I felt incredibly silly and a little uncomfortable being a weirdo in front of a circle of strangers. The silly games continued for the next two hours, with everyone gradually getting more comfortable. At times, we all gave each other pretty big laughs. I volunteered to create a scene with another person and it felt so natural and was so so so much fun. We even got a couple big laughs. At the end, it seemed like everyone had a great time, including me. As self-conscious as I felt, at the end of the class I realized that all of my stress had gone away. A few of us ending up talking at the end and exchanged numbers. We started a group chat so we could take the same Improv 101 class. When I walked out, I felt happier and more content than I had in a long time. It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off of me and I felt like I was floating. I'm a pretty depressed and anxious person so this was a great feeling. My girlfriend was waiting for me outside and she saw it in my face. She said she rarely sees me glow like that. 

So I start my first class of eight this Thursday. I'm so excited. I have a feeling that this could be my thing. It feels so good to have made friends in this already. I rarely make new friends. I'm looking forward to being silly with a group of equally silly people for two hours a week. I'm just having a lot of good feelings about this. I hope that I can become a part of your community.

435,improv,"Hey there,

I host an improvised comedy podcast based around wrestling called Wrestle Daddies. Basically what we do is take a suggestion for a wrestling character, gimmick, or even just name and fully develop that idea into a fully fledged wrestler and book them in feuds or storylines.

We are 14 episodes in and have gotten a tad bit ridiculous at points. We are looking to ground ourselves in a more self contained structure. Problem is, we have exhausted a lot of our suggestions.

We are looking for more suggestion so anything you got would be greatly appreciated!! A name, a full idea, anything. 

And if you want check us out and give us some feedback. We realize a couple of the early episodes are week, but come grow with us!

436,improv,"Hoping this is the right place to ask!

I'm running a team meeting in a couple of weeks and rather than just doing the boring stats and strategy etc etc, I'd like to shake things up and get everyone doing something a bit different. We are a small team working within a much larger department and wider business, making outbound calls to retailers as sales representatives. It's not exactly selling - but we are looking after the people who sell our products and encouraging them to sell better.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience of doing corporate improvisation sessions, using drama and improv to help increase team unity whilst also exploring good customer service, listening skills, communication, empathy, that kind of thing. There is a big focus in the business at the moment around making every contact with our customers and clientele brilliant, and I really think that doing some improv and workshopping will prove astronomically useful in this regard.

I have a degree in drama and have some experience running this kind of thing - but no experience of doing so in a corporate environment 😭 I've got some ideas but would really love to hear from someone who's actually done stuff like this before!

442,improv,"Within the past month or so we've seen an influx of troll posts and users. Most of which, just seem to want to get a rise out of us for some weird reason. (Like why /r/improv? We're a pretty small community). For the most part I appreciate the laissez faire approach you guys have to moderating. Even with the influx of troll posts, I think its pretty reasonable to downvote, ignore, and move on. I'm not a big fan of banning users or content especially in a community as small as ours.

With that being said, 8 days ago I made a post on this subreddit. It was an obvious bit post. I will totally admit it was pretty blue, crude, and may not have been everyone's cup of tea in terms of humor. The question was ""What is your favorite improv sex position?"". I gave a pretty graphic description of mine in the text post to show it was totally a joke. I can understand if you thought it went too far and thus took it down - However, I feel that's kind of a fucked up thing to do considering its not something often done to posts here. In addition it really irks me that I wasn't even sent a message or anything telling me that my post was taken down, or WHY it was taken down.

I am obviously not a troll. I've been a pretty active member of this community since October 2015, on this account at least. Though, I followed this sub when I began improv on an older account back in 2012. My point is that I obviously care about this place and community. I don't ONLY submit bit posts. In fact the vast majority of my contributions to this sub are comments giving advice. I write entire novels here in the comment section because I care about helping people, I care about expressing opinions (not just my own), and I care about discussing this amazing artform. But I also really like to have fun. And it seems like we can no longer do that here by posting bits.

I've been going back and forth on whether to post something about this or not. But with the looks of the current front page on this sub with posts about ""improv and thirst"" - where the OP asks us how we deal with all the attractive improv girls we want to fuck. That post, that is pretty damn misogynistic, stays up. Yet, my joke post gets taken down. It just kind of struck a nerve.

I don't feel like my post was 'offensive' at all. However, I'll own up to it being low-brow, blue, and crude. I don't think thats a valid reason to take it down, but I can understand and live with it if I crossed some line (though I have no idea what that line is).

I want to reiterate that I don't think y'all are bad guys. I just want a little transparency is all. Maybe we should have a larger discussion on what content we want to see here and how we want the mods to deal with 'bad' content.

TLDR;
My ""What's your favorite improv sex position?"" bit post got taken down without a message or reason as to why.

I've found it very difficult to make small talk at a bar after a show, or keeping in touch with people after a class or structured team program like Supernova is over. 

Advice I've gotten has always been to hang out at Mcmamus/Walters/Triple Crown/whatever the new improv bar is and meet people, but I've often found diminishing returns through that. Same with going to see other people's shows. (My social anxiety and depression, of course, doesn't help)

It's a design/strategy heavy group within F500. I took a few second city classes, (on level C)but would always appreciate any additional thoughts if people had experience with this!

I'm not well versed enough to know the exact names for each exercise, but here are some I was thinking:

- Name Alliteration Game
- Arrow Clap game
- Bibbidy Bibbidy
- Count together as a group with your eyes closed
- Group of three, two people tell a story at same time
- Walk in a room and people stop when they notice someone else has.
- Scene setting (who,what, where) 

I'll do a bit more research to refine that list, but thats what Im thinking for now.

If anyone has any comments or ideas for more, Id love to hear them! Thank you.

486,improv,"Hiiiii friends. So I've been improvising for two and a half years. The past year has been full of wonderful times in a class troupe that I love and have felt very safe and supported and playful in. But....then some life shit happened and I lost a couple of auditions that classmates won and I became very depressed. Improv had been my escape the past couple of years...my thing that always brought joy, my thing that didn't matter too much (not precious), and now it just feels so heavy and precious and the pressure to improve as an improvisor became unbearable. I cracked last weekend and realized I dreaded every class, every show, and couldn't laugh anymore when I was in the audience. Throw in some suicidal ideation and I had myself a bad situation that I knew I needed to step back from. UGH.

So...I have quit classes for now, taken a step back from my other troupes, and I feel lost. I don't want to quit forever, but I just couldn't stand the pressure anymore (self-induced pressure, I will admit). I'm afraid I won't return to it, and am so sad that my mental illness (depression! Woo!) has gotten in the way of something I truly love(d).

Any tips, experiences, words of wisdom? Have any of you taken breaks for various reasons (mental health, physical health, life circumstances) and returned to it later? 

Thank you in advance for any feedback or sharing of experiences.",Improv &amp; Depression &amp; Taking Breaks,"Hiiiii friends. So I've been improvising for two and a half years.

514,improv,"Hey all, I'm a relatively new improviser in Chicago and I plan on going to
 the coached ensemble auditions this weekend.  The instructions say to bring a ""theater resume"".  I've searched posts in this subreddit about said resumes and I feel like I get the jist of what goes on there.

Name, physical descriptions, theater experience/past shows, and skills.

The problem is, I don't have any prior theater experience outside of the Second City classes I've been taking.

So ultimately, I guess I was just wondering how much I can reach on my resume as far as experience goes?  For example, in High School (I'm 20 by the way, so I'm not too far removed from it) I was in the pit orchestra for our winter musicals and I won a poetry slam with a comedic poem amongst my sophomore class (around 700ish people).  My logic is that pit orchestra at least exposed me to the theatrical environment and the poetry slam, although just a one time thing, counts as performance and writing experience.

And also, since I'm writing this, what constitutes skills?  I've seen examples in past posts that instruments, accents, and physical abilities are all good things to put on there.  So would it make sense for me to put the fact that I can play saxophone on their? Or would that be silly?  The reason I ask is that I don't really see the relevance in regards to improv.

Yes Man (obvious reasons) 


Buster Keaton's movies/Monthy Python and the Holy Grail (for comedy studies and different ways to be funny, even if the argument is too big)

Ghostbusters (going to crazy town step by step)

I am curious how ya'll strike a balance between giving space in a scene through pauses between lines and taking your time and getting stage time with a team.  I play with a lot of aggressive players which forces me to speak right after they do or interrupt them to get a line out in a scene.

527,improv,"Hi everyone! 

I don't have any prior experience in comedy or improv- I'm hoping to take an intro class to help me get out of my shell and be more fun in my daily interactions.

Actually I have sat in one improv meeting before. Nothing was explained to me and I was just on the stage for one of the exercises- I bombed hard! My mind went blank and couldn't get anything going. 

So, by taking an intro improv class I'm hoping to challenge myself to be in a vulnerable situation. I want to get better at it.

I feel like since it's not something that comes naturally for me, I want to prepare myself to get the most out of the 6 week course that I'm planning on signing up for. My fear is that I would show up and keep bombing it to the point where i don't really get much out of the experience other than embarrassment. 

Any kind of thoughts or inputs would be appreciated!

532,improv,"I’ve been asking teams and students a question recently.

I ask them to pay attention to specific actions they might see on stage at an improv show:

* Stopping
* Avoiding
* Delaying

Great improv scenes represent of some activity: fixing a car, eating meal, breaking up, talking to your boss, making an arrest. Absent of some activity, scenes devolve into detached talking heads performances.

The core of a great scene is: people in a place doing a thing for a reason.

The next time you’re at a show, keep an eye out for when the performers stop, avoid, and delay the thing they're  characters are there to do.

Sometimes stopping can be very in your face. In a scene at a restaurant players might ignore their food by the end.

Improvisers can be highly skilled at inventing all kinds of reasons to avoid or delay the action of the scene. Very popular tactics include: It’s everybody’s first day, nobody knows how to do anything, somebody’s dad died, and frequently some tool is missing from the spare-tire kit.

In addition to looking for these in other shows, pay attention to your own play. Are you stopping, avoiding, and delaying?

What can be done to avoid SAD improv? One of the original Kitchen Rules says to make active choices.

When the activity of a scene has been established we’re given a lot of material to work with. TJ &amp; Dave talk about doing “the next little thing”. If we know what we’re doing, we have a lot of actions we can take next.

I like to think of those images of the average face. They strip away everything that could be unique about a face. If we think of our scenes as having a labeled activity, we can think of a hypothetical average scene. Layer all the _getting ready to go out_ scenes on top of each other and average them out. What is still in the average scene? What actions can we make out when all the unique versions of that scene blend together?

* Tying ties
* Adjusting jewelry
* Applying makeup
* Looking in the mirror
* Brushing teeth/mouthwash
* Blowdrying hair
* Getting wallet, keys, watch
* Using the toilet

That’s just the most obvious stuff and there’s definitely enough to do to last as long as you need it to. One could blow through those at an hurried pace of 30 seconds each and still have a four minute scene.

Pay attention to activities in scenes and how much stopping, avoiding, and delaying you see, and maybe even do yourself.","Stopping, avoiding, and delaying in scenes","I’ve been asking teams and students a question recently.

553,improv,"Yeah. I said it. Would love love LOVE some advice on this lil' situation I've got going on. I've been dabbling in comedy for a while and started taking improv classes a year ago. And after learning and growing (and laughing!), the director asked me to join the actual cast! Super honored and excited!! But as I continue to rehearse with the cast, I'm noticing a downward spiral happening. I'm not being aggressive with getting off the back line, I'm second guessing my ideas...I'm in my head. And, obviously, it's affecting my confidence, which is affecting my performance. I do know I'm a good improviser; they wouldn't have asked me to join if otherwise. But wondering if other people have felt/experienced this and how they learned to deal with it. Thank you in advance, friends!

574,improv,"I want to preface this entire thing by saying that I know that I have a lot to learn (and always will, which makes this whole form so great)!

Some friends and I founded a troupe at my University last Fall, to differing levels of success. We've gotten good reception on campus, performed at the local Comedy Club, and have gained a decent chunk of traction. Our roster is floating, with 10-12ish consistent people showing up to what amounts to open jams 2 days a week. Given that it's currently summer, we meet once a week, and only for the people who are in our college town over the summer. It's been okay for the most part, but I feel like we're starting to hit a rut. Basically, I'm not the person ""in charge"" of the troupe, but I'm not particularly happy with the direction we're going in.


It feels as though the general demeanor has shifted, both in the sense of personal relationships and intent with the troupe. We've all gotten very close, which is wonderful. But at the same time, our closeness has kind of turned rehearsals into ""fuck-around-with-friends-time."" I don't deny that some of this is due in part to semi-common get-togethers where the plan is to get drunk and do nothing as a troupe. I feel like there are certainly members of the troupe who feel similarly, but I feel as though there is a divide between what people want out of the group . 


I've been doing my best to improve (taking some local improv classes over the summer, listening to Improv podcasts, attending weekly open jams outside of our group), and grow as an improviser. I really truly love doing improv, and it's helped me a lot in breaking out of my shell; I just feel as though I've reached a point where I want to keep improving, and our current set-up just isn't helping. 


To elaborate, we've done workshopping and scene-study in the past, but that's fallen to the wayside in a few different ways. We have a tendency to not let scenes progress naturally, and wipe them after a single joke (or to have 3 people jump in, with 4 scenes occurring simultaneously, basically succumbing to a bunch of noise). Similarly, we'll often get stuck in our own running jokes that have been disillusioning to people joining up late in the game. We had 13 people play at a recent performance, and it was an absolute mess; there was just too many people trying to do too many things at the same time. The person conducting ""auditions"" for this performance refused to cut anyone, despite us receiving notice that our performing team should not exceed 8 players. 


At the same time, I see people in our troupe who just haven't really improved in the span of our existence. I understand that different people take to improv in different ways, but after consistently being blocked in a scene by someone who's been doing improv with us for 6 months, it becomes frustrating. **I cannot stress enough that these people are my friends and have shaped my college experience so much for the better.** At the same time, I just feel trapped in my situation. I want to bring up these concerns to the person who facilitates our troupe, but I don't want to step on his toes or cause in-fighting. 


Given that we never had an actual audition process (with cuts), my thought process was that it might be beneficial to break into two smaller teams for people interested in short-form and long-form respectively (since we currently just do both whenever it suits us), and then audition some incoming Freshman to change up the dynamics. As I understand it, the current plan is to just keep doing what we're doing, and I don't know if I can keep with it. 


I'm not trying to be elitist or selfish, please forgive me if it comes across as such. I just feel stuck and I don't want to hurt anyone. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

580,improv,"[A bit over a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/6lfxbz/help_me_name_some_improv_forms_that_dont_exist/) I asked for suggestions of improv forms that don't exist for an event we call Form Jam. We had the jam last night and it was a huge success.

Here are the games we played and descriptions of each. Most of them are short form games but some of them are more longform in nature. Thanks again to everyone for the suggestions!

**Take It Elsewhere -** Players do a normal scene. At any time, the host may call ""Take it elsewhere"" and get a suggestion from the audience as to the new location. Players continue the scene as if it has always taken place at that location.

**The Klein Bottle -** Players do a normal scene. Using an improv suggestion app, the host can call out ""add essence of &lt;suggestion&gt;"" at any time and players must continue the scene by adding that element but without calling attention to it. Host may also give individual players new essences to incorporate.

**Jorge Posada's Daydream -** Three players take the position of a batter, catcher, and umpire. The catcher starts telling a story about a dream they had, which all players then tag to and act out. When the players return to the batting scene, they switch positions until all players have had a chance to tell a daydream story.

**Freeze Dodgeball -** An all play game played like Freeze Tag. Two players start a scene. At any time, a player not in the scene can yell ""freeze"", at which the players stop the scene and stop moving. They then attempt to tag a player in the scene with the ball. If the player is hit, whoever threw the ball takes the exact pose of the player they're replacing and initiates a new scene. If the player dodges the ball, the scene continues but players must justify whatever new position they find themselves in after dodging. If the player catches the ball, whoever threw the ball must enter the scene as a new character. Head hits don't count, just like normal dodgeball.

**World's Worst (but not the shortform version) -** An audience member tells the story of a very memorable day in their lives. The players then show the complete worst version of that day.

**The Hedge Maze -** Players start a monoscene. Once the scene reaches a boiling point or edit-worthy moment, someone sweeps the stage. Whoever sweeps repeats a line of dialogue that they said earlier in the scene, and now we see a new ""branch"" or ""path"" that the scene could have taken from that point. Players can sweep and re-start the scene from any line of dialogue at any time to see a new path.

**Universal Constants -** Players do a roughly 1 minute scene, after which the host calls time. The host then picks one aspect of the scene to remain constant (a pose, a relationship, a character voice, anything) and the players do a totally new scene with that previously established constant as part of the new scene. The host then repeats, adding more constants that carry over from scene to scene (so if a pose was set as a constant in scene 1, that pose will continue throughout all following scenes)

**Where Will Christ Show Up? -** Three players each get a suggestion of a fictional god and two aspects they represent. They then do a Family Dinner-style scene until a fourth player decides to crash the party as Jesus.

**Facebrain Hooplah -** Another hosted game. Players start a scene and at any time the host can call a player's name and then one of the following: Face: the player must incorporate a facial expression and strong emotional reaction into their next line of dialogue. Brain: the player must reveal a secret about their character. Hooplah: the player must throw out a non-sequitur or other random line of dialogue that is then justified.

**Short Story Long -** An audience member starts telling a story but the moment the story starts to get interesting (within 2-3 sentences) the players thank them for their time and then act out the story they haven't heard.

**Interesting! -** Players start a scene with one player on the sidelines. When one of the players in the scene says something the waiting player likes, they say ""Interesting!"" and then repeat the thing they found interesting about what was said. They then replace the other player in the scene and start a whole new scene with the player who said the interesting line of dialogue.

**Fairytale Beginnings -** Players get a suggestion of things that landed them in jail. They then do a scene where they talk about how their perfect upbringing somehow led them naturally to commit this crime.

**Jiminy Cricket -** Two players do a scene with a third on the sidelines. When someone says something that seems untruthful, the third player says ""That doesn't sound right, let's see what really happened/what they really meant/etc."" and players jump to see what really happened. We then cut back to the first scene and both characters now know the truth.

**Not Quite -** Players do a scene, and then the host edits and says ""That's not quite what happened. What was different about this scene?"" and the audience can call out suggestions of what was different (two players were actually spies, one of the characters is mute, etc.). The scene is repeated.

**Hourglass Martini -** Played similar to Countdown. Players do a one minute scene, a 30 second version of that scene, a 15 second version of that scene, and then a 1 second version of that scene. Players then go back up, doing 15 second, 30 second, and 1 minute versions of the scene. The twist is that the characters need to become progressively more drunk as players work their way back up to the 1 minute scene, at which point they should be completely hammered.

**Center Central -** It's like a monoscene + dime store novel. Players start a monoscene in which they each tell stories, as they start their story the other two players stand up and act it out. The player telling the story can add or change aspects of the story as it's acted out. Repeat until all players have told a story.

**Spooky Action at a Distance -** Players get a suggestion of a party that would be really cool or fun to go to and then play the most Debbie-Downer-type characters that might be at that kind of party.",I asked you for improv forms that don't exist. Here are the results!,"A bit over a week ago]( I asked for suggestions of improv forms that don't exist for an event we call Form Jam. We had the jam last night and it was a huge success.  Here are the games we played and descriptions of each. Most of them are short form games but some of them are more longform in nature. Thanks again to everyone for the suggestions!  **Take It Elsewhere  ** Players do a normal scene. At any time, the host may call ""Take it elsewhere"" and get a suggestion from the audience as to the new location. Players continue the scene as if it has always taken place at that location.  **The Klein Bottle  ** Players do a normal scene. Using an improv suggestion app, the host can call out ""add essence of <suggestion>"" at any time and players must continue the scene by adding that element but without calling attention to it. Host may also give individual players new essences to incorporate.  **Jorge Posada's Daydream  ** Three players take the position of a batter, catcher, and umpire. The catcher starts telling a story about a dream they had, which all players then tag to and act out. When the players return to the batting scene, they switch positions until all players have had a chance to tell a daydream story.  **Freeze Dodgeball  ** An all play game played like Freeze Tag. Two players start a scene. At any time, a player not in the scene can yell ""freeze"", at which the players stop the scene and stop moving. They then attempt to tag a player in the scene with the ball. If the player is hit, whoever threw the ball takes the exact pose of the player they're replacing and initiates a new scene. If the player dodges the ball, the scene continues but players must justify whatever new position they find themselves in after dodging. If the player catches the ball, whoever threw the ball must enter the scene as a new character. Head hits don't count, just like normal dodgeball.  **World's Worst (but not the shortform version)  ** An audience member tells the story of a very memorable day in their lives. The players then show the complete worst version of that day.  **The Hedge Maze  ** Players start a monoscene. Once the scene reaches a boiling point or edit worthy moment, someone sweeps the stage. Whoever sweeps repeats a line of dialogue that they said earlier in the scene, and now we see a new ""branch"" or ""path"" that the scene could have taken from that point. Players can sweep and re start the scene from any line of dialogue at any time to see a new path.  **Universal Constants  ** Players do a roughly 1 minute scene, after which the host calls time. The host then picks one aspect of the scene to remain constant (a pose, a relationship, a character voice, anything) and the players do a totally new scene with that previously established constant as part of the new scene.

I've been practicing improv with a partner for some time now. We've both been preforming improv off/on for 4-5 years now. Mainly a part of a larger troupe, but we've been recently working on a two-hander.

I apologize if I'm explaining this poorly or using the wrong terminology, but we either get stuck in scenes or they go flat at practice.
It's like we're able to set-up the details (who/where/what), but struggle with the action/progression of the scene. For example we can to a point where know we are siblings in a haunted mansion looking for ghosts, and then we freeze.

Are there any exercises/things we can do at practice to help us get better at this? Do you think the problem could be fixed through a better understanding of a Skill we are lacking in?

610,improv,"This is something I have been confused by recently in scenes.. I'm going to use an initiation in the UCB manual:

""Keep your eyes closed hunny we are almost there. Do you smell coffee? Happy anniversary!""

It came from a pattern game with the premise: having your anniversary at a starbucks..

So my question is, and I know there is no right answer, but would it be a stronger choice for the wife to react truthfully- ""Jeff I know we met here at this starbucks, but its a little weird to bring me here on our anniversary- you promised me dinner."" 

OR would it be more interesting for the wife to play ""Oh hunny! My Favorite place! You are so romantic. What are we eating?""

I guess my question is how do you know when to play a voice of reason (straight character) and when to play the opposite of what the audience expects? I'm not sure if this is just UCB style vs Chicago style improv or what but I am a little confused.

624,improv,"There was [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/6l0k78/yo_whats_going_on_at_dsi/) mentioning the shitstorm leading up to this, but I wanted to make a new post with as much information as I could.

For those who don't know, DSI is a comedy club in Chapel Hill, NC. Originally just improv, they branched out and included standup and sketch as well. Brief background on myself: I've been performing since 2008. I took some classes there and performed with a few teams a few years ago, but it was never my home theater.

Last year, there was a mass exodus from DSI. There was a lot of talk going around about some shit owner Zach Ward had pulled concerning women at the club. This was an email he sent to the staff: http://imgur.com/a/zK4DZ

Earlier this week, a good friend of mine, Vinny, the former associate director at DSI, made a Facebook post about some of Zach's actions in terms of where performers were allowed to do shows. This spiraled into many people telling stories about Zach's improprieties. [Note: any Facebook posts here are public]

https://www.facebook.com/vinnyfureel/posts/10155413825963718

This led to some crew members leaving: https://www.facebook.com/eric.grosskurth/posts/10212665874303689

Zach responded with this post on a private group for DSI members: http://imgur.com/a/ADxVY

This was the post that set me off. It was one thing hearing stories from people I either didn't know, or had vaguely met at a show, but this post by my friend Grace made me physically ill: https://www.facebook.com/yourfriendgrace/posts/10100384359367805?pnref=story

Apology, this is where I no longer have screen shots, as people were just sharing text with me. Zach sent this email to the DSI community yesterday:

Statement from Zach Ward

DSI,

I have been made aware of the Facebook post by Grace Baldridge Carnes. I continue to be contacted by mutual friends, colleagues and members of the community who are reaching out to make sure I am aware of the post and to express their support. For that, I am grateful. Many of these people were/are aware of the details of my past relationship with Grace. I am just as shocked and confused by the post as many of those who have reached out to me to express their disbelief.

Grace and I had many things in common, finding each other at a time when we were both dealing with marriages that didn't work out and learning the ropes of single parenting. We had a very amicable end to our romantic relationship and continued to be friends for over a year. We had sexual intercourse on several occasions, always consensual, as adults in a romantic relationship often do. When the relationship deteriorated, I stopped returning her messages, many of which were sexual in nature and others were increasingly agitated. I blocked her on social media which is why I did not see the post until alerted by concerned friends.

The post describes a sexual encounter in a manner that includes completely fabricated details leading a reader to believe that a sexual assault occurred. I can understand how those not familiar with the relationship between me and Grace would, based on that post, believe that it was a one night stand with allegations that literally make me sick. These are not allegations that I take lightly. They are serious and they are absolutely false. The sexual encounter in the Facebook post simply did not take place as Grace described.

While I am humbled by the support of my friends and colleagues, especially those who know all the details of my past relationship with Grace, the post still upsets me, confuses me, and leaves me wondering how someone could fabricate such an event that some women actually experience way too often.

These false allegations have already taken a toll on my personal wellbeing as well as my business. DSI is my passion and life's work. I have met many great people through my involvement with improv comedy. I have endeavored to cultivate an environment of safety, inclusion, and tolerance at DSI. I have addressed head on any issues that have been brought to my attention and I take them seriously.

We have postponed shows previously scheduled for this week so our staff and performers can ask questions and reset. Cast members can reach out to directors about rehearsals. We look forward to camps, classes and shows next week.

-----

Finally, I woke up this morning to find that he sent this email: 

DSI,

Considering the content and tone of recent conversations, for the health of the community and a possible future for the theater, I have decided to remove myself from all theater operations, taking an indefinite leave from DSI and comedy effective Monday July 10th. It is my sincere hope that the community will continue to produce great work, no longer divided, and that the comedians and artists who have worked to help build DSI since 2003 will continue to do so, for each other.

I am aware of the Facebook conversation started by Vinny Valdivia and I have heard those who say that I hurt them. I am sorry. I have only ever wanted people to be happy and feel safe. I recognize now that, at least for a lot of people who participated in that conversation, some of whom I (sadly) haven't seen for over a decade, the cloud around me has become the largest threat to what DSI stands for: Community, built on positivity, optimism and unconditional support.

I am genuinely sorry for the impact my relationships and my leadership have had on the theater and our community. I have been truly grateful for the opportunity to have supported such a special space for comedy in North Carolina, working with some of the most incredible students and inspiring performers in the country.
How does this work.

Public operations (shows, public classes and cast rehearsals) have been postponed this weekend, 7/6-7/8, and next weekend, 7/13-7/15. 

Like a Girl Comedy Festival, scheduled Thursday 7/27 - Sunday 7/30, has been postponed indefinitely. Artist messages will be sent tonight.

An update on a theater leadership transition, one where Zach Ward will no longer be the owner of DSI, will be sent by 7pm Monday 7/10.

In the very least, DSI has a commitment to parents and students to run summer camps and classes through the end of August. These classes and camps will be administered by School Director Brandon Holmes.
Weekend operations (shows and cast rehearsals) could resume after a new leadership team are able to assess casts and potential programming.

There are details to work out, but I wanted to make sure that my intention to step down from DSI and turnover the theater was clear ―and that I sent this message sooner rather than later. I have never wanted people to feel this much pain. I want the company to come out of limbo, if possible, so the community can heal.

reaching out to make sure i am aware of the post and to express their support for that i am grateful many of these people wereare aware of the details of my past relationship with grace i am just as shocked and confused by the post as many of those who have reached out to me to express their disbelief  grace and i had many things in common finding each other at a time when we were both dealing with marriages that didnt work out and learning the ropes of single parenting we had a very amicable end to our romantic relationship and continued to be friends for over a year we had sexual intercourse on several occasions always consensual as adults in a romantic relationship often do when the relationship deteriorated i stopped returning her messages many of which were sexual in nature and others were increasingly agitated i blocked her on social media which is why i did not see the post until alerted by concerned friends  the post describes a sexual encounter in a manner that includes completely fabricated details leading a reader to believe that a sexual assault occurred i can understand how those not familiar with the relationship between me and grace would based on that post believe that it was a one night stand with allegations that literally make me sick these are not allegations that i take lightly they are serious and they are absolutely false the sexual encounter in the facebook post simply did not take place as grace described  while i am humbled by the support of my friends and colleagues especially those who know all the details of my past relationship with grace the post still upsets me confuses me and leaves me wondering how someone could fabricate such an event that some women actually experience way too often  these false allegations have already taken a toll on my personal wellbeing as well as my business dsi is my passion and lifes work i have met many great people through my involvement with improv comedy i have endeavored to cultivate an environment of safety inclusion and tolerance at dsi i have addressed head on any issues that have been brought to my attention and i take them seriously  we have postponed shows previously scheduled for this week so our staff and performers can ask questions and reset cast members can reach out to directors about rehearsals we look forward to camps classes and shows next week         finally i woke up this morning to find that he sent this email   dsi  considering the content and tone of recent conversations for the health of the community and a possible future for the theater i have decided to remove myself from all theater operations taking an indefinite leave from dsi and comedy effective monday july 10th it is my sincere hope that the community will continue to produce great work no longer divided and that the comedians and artists who have worked to help build dsi since 2003 will continue to do so for each other  i am aware of the facebook conversation started by vinny valdivia and i have heard those who say that i hurt them i am sorry i have only ever wanted people to be happy and feel safe i recognize now that at least for a lot of people who participated in that conversation some of whom i sadly havent seen for over a decade the cloud around me has become the largest threat to what dsi stands for community built on positivity optimism and unconditional support  i am genuinely sorry for the impact my relationships and my leadership have had on the theater and our community i have been truly grateful for the opportunity to have supported such a special space for comedy in north carolina working with some of the most incredible students and inspiring performers in the country how does this work  public operations shows public classes and cast rehearsals have been postponed this weekend 76 78 and next weekend 713 715   like a girl comedy festival scheduled thursday 727   sunday 730 has been postponed indefinitely artist messages will be sent tonight  an update on a theater leadership transition one where zach ward will no longer be the owner of dsi will be sent by 7pm monday 710  in the very least dsi has a commitment to parents and students to run summer camps and classes through the end of august these classes and camps will be administered by school director brandon holmes weekend operations shows and cast rehearsals could resume after a new leadership team are able to assess casts and potential programming  there are details to work out but i wanted to make sure that my intention to step down from dsi and turnover the theater was clear and that i sent this message sooner rather than later i have never wanted people to feel this much pain i want the company to come out of limbo if possible so the community can heal          this is the story as i know it i will update this post with any news  update article from cambridge day in massachusetts  update article from the indy week a local publication  update durham based herald sun newspaper article  update it appears the dsi comedy facebook page has been  and zach has either deleted his account or blocked anyone that has been commenting in the public posts edit   i was just informed by a facebook friend of his that was not a part of this discussion that he has apparently deactivated his account   zach ward  dsi comedy

633,improv,"Hi everyone. I'm starting improv level 1 classes next month and I'm excited about it. My only experience is from professional wrestling. I did it for a little over 10 years and had several different characters. Unfortunately I was never on television(only did independent/small shows) but I had so many fun opportunities and memories of improvising on camera and in front of live audiences as these made up characters. But I know improv is a different ball game and it's a new experience that I respect and am excited to become a part of.

But I have to be honest, I'm nervous. While it may not be weird to so many of you, it's weird to me that I was rarely nervous in front of big crowds when I was talking and performing in the ring yet the idea of being on stage does make me a bit nervous. I've always been humble yet confident in myself to perform, but just the different atmosphere of improv makes me have that nerve-wracking feeling. Regardless, I am stoked to become a part of improv and learn as much as I can.

637,improv,"The comedy club I take classes at now teaches long form, primarily the Harold. I'm in 301 and I pretty much have the basics down and I have my grounded characters down really solid, but the one thing I've been struggling with lately is playing the unusual well. I either draw blanks and can't think of a good pattern quick enough or when I do, I have trouble jumping directly into the scene. 

There's another club in my city that does short form game based improv, I've been to a couple shows and realized that in short form there's never really any just standing-talking scenes. Due to the nature of short form improv games it's pretty much all action from the very start of the scene. 

So my question is would learning short form benefit me playing the unusual character in a Harold. Would it condition me to jump into a scene with more energy? Also I'm open to any other tips from anyone else who has struggled with playing the unusual in the past.

In the 1st beat, the initiator started dancing and the scene partner started dancing, the initiator offered the scene partner checks with pictures of him dancing and asked for his son as payment for the checks. 

I took the game as being a salesman who dances and asks for family members as payment. When I went to initiate a 2nd beat, I started dancing with the original scene partner, I offered to paint pictures of him dancing onto his house and asked for his dead parents for payment.

When he went over the 2nd beat, he said that the pattern was there, but that the scene was weird. He paused and did not say anything else about it. I took this as being a bad move on my part, worse than what had happened in the original scene.

I'm aware of the Second City, obviously, and Bad Dog and the classes they offer, but can someone with experience tell me which one might be better for me and what I'm looking for, namely meeting people and getting some stage time and smaller classes?  Also, what's the best way to get on stage in Toronto? Are there any good jams to attend regularly? How easy is it to submit a troupe to perform at certain theaters?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

So I've been doing Improv for the past decade on and off. But around 7 or 8 years ago I found myself unable to really keep up with a troupe. Being in the navy, moving around and working the odd weekend will do that.

A friend of mine got me involved in Larping while I was in Pensacola and I realized how many similarities there are between playing a character all weekend at a game and long form improv. I've been using larp since then to practice and hone my skills.

Which brings me to two questions:

1. Have any of you also had experience using larp for improv improvement and if so, how have you found it?

2. For those familiar, what advanced skills would you recommend practicing?

It's been interesting trying to make scenes work and supporting narratives when the other people involved don't necessarily have the same background or understanding of how to positively and productively contribute. It's like an entire weekend of that improv game where your partners deliberately try to screw you over with ""no's"" and not providing input.

712,improv,"I moved to a small community and started a drop-in, improv jam club about a year and a half ago. We started in someone's living room and now rent a space for 2 hours every week where we meet and practice. It costs $3 to drop in, which all go towards the space rental. Although we are all amateurs, usually one of us will facilitate and decide what warm-ups and games we are going to do. Our club has about 60 members but maybe only a dozen of those people show up semi-regularly, with a few really dedicated members.

Things have been going along pretty well, considering, but lately there have been things that are becoming frustrating:

Members tend to show up at 7, when practice is scheduled to begin, and then chit chat with each other for 15 minutes before they will settle down to start to practice. I have already added a 10 minute break in the middle of the two hours and we usually go for beer after club. I have offered to get to the space to open it early so people can hobnob before practice, but people say they're ""too busy"" and can only come at 7. I put a lot of work into getting this club going and I'm frustrated ate the erosion of time spent actually doing improv. It started as 2 hours and is now down to 1:35. Also, as people figure out that we don't actually start until 10 or 15 minutes after, they start arriving later and later. Part of our agreement with the space is we keep the front door locked, so every late arrival is a disruption.

I see this as a matter of adulthood and integrity. You don't show up at yoga and then waste 15 minutes of everybody's yoga time by refusing to settle down and begin.

Another issue that is happening is some people are complaining about how other people facilitate. To me, if you're the one holding the shovel, you decide where the hole will be dug. In other words, if someone decides to facilitate, they get to decide what to focus on and what games to play. Anybody is welcome to facilitate, so if they have an idea of how they want it done they should do it that way.

The third issue is some of us have started performing publicly with each other and it makes awkward politics with people who aren't invited to participate for whatever reason. This is a drop in club where anybody can go to jam and we don't always jive with each others styles.

I'm looking for advice on howto handle the politics of the facilitation and feelings.

I am also looking for advice about how to deal with the time issue. I want to draw up a brief set of agreements that can guide the club which includes an agreement to start and finish on time, but I don't want to do it all on my own because that seems dictatory. (I have tried twice to form a board of directors for the club and have only had a few takers). I am considering calling a ""general meeting"" where everyone can attend but I also consider the time thing to be non-negotiable. I have worked very hard to get this club going, I have produced professional workshops where I hired and arranged professional improvisors to come in, I produced our fundraiser (which took me 4 days), found affordable practice space and have been there every week for consistency, all because *I just want to practice some improv*. I wanted 2 hours a week, I can accept 1:50, but I didn't do all this to facilitate people's need for social interaction.
How can I get them to understand that if 10 people start 15 minutes late we are wasting a cumulative 2 and a half hours?

I am not a very good communicator and need a way to present this where people are open to listening and also, hopefully, agreeing. Any advice?

Another issue that is happening is some people are complaining about how other people facilitate. To me, if you're the one holding the shovel, you decide where the hole will be dug. In other words, if someone decides to facilitate, they get to decide what to focus on and what games to play. Anybody is welcome to facilitate, so if they have an idea of how they want it done they should do it that way.  The third issue is some of us have started performing publicly with each other and it makes awkward politics with people who aren't invited to participate for whatever reason. This is a drop in club where anybody can go to jam and we don't always jive with each others styles.  I'm looking for advice on howto handle the politics of the facilitation and feelings.  I am also looking for advice about how to deal with the time issue. I want to draw up a brief set of agreements that can guide the club which includes an agreement to start and finish on time, but I don't want to do it all on my own because that seems dictatory. (I have tried twice to form a board of directors for the club and have only had a few takers). I am considering calling a ""general meeting"" where everyone can attend but I also consider the time thing to be non negotiable. I have worked very hard to get this club going, I have produced professional workshops where I hired and arranged professional improvisors to come in, I produced our fundraiser (which took me 4 days), found affordable practice space and have been there every week for consistency, all because *I just want to practice some improv*. I wanted 2 hours a week, I can accept 1:50, but I didn't do all this to facilitate people's need for social interaction. How can I get them to understand that if 10 people start 15 minutes late we are wasting a cumulative 2 and a half hours?  I am not a very good communicator and need a way to present this where people are open to listening and also, hopefully, agreeing. Any advice?   Don't know how to fix problems with casual weekly improv jam. Advice sought.",i moved to a small community and started a drop in improv jam club about a year and a half ago we started in someones living room and now rent a space for 2 hours every week where we meet and practice it costs 3 to drop in which all go towards the space rental although we are all amateurs usually one of us will facilitate and decide what warm ups and games we are going to do our club has about 60 members but maybe only a dozen of those people show up semi regularly with a few really dedicated members  things have been going along pretty well considering but lately there have been things that are becoming frustrating  members tend to show up at 7 when practice is scheduled to begin and then chit chat with each other for 15 minutes before they will settle down to start to practice i have already added a 10 minute break in the middle of the two hours and we usually go for beer after club i have offered to get to the space to open it early so people can hobnob before practice but people say theyre too busy and can only come at 7 i put a lot of work into getting this club going and im frustrated ate the erosion of time spent actually doing improv it started as 2 hours and is now down to 135 also as people figure out that we dont actually start until 10 or 15 minutes after they start arriving later and later part of our agreement with the space is we keep the front door locked so every late arrival is a disruption  i see this as a matter of adulthood and integrity you dont show up at yoga and then waste 15 minutes of everybodys yoga time by refusing to settle down and begin  another issue that is happening is some people are complaining about how other people facilitate to me if youre the one holding the shovel you decide where the hole will be dug in other words if someone decides to facilitate they get to decide what to focus on and what games to play anybody is welcome to facilitate so if they have an idea of how they want it done they should do it that way  the third issue is some of us have started performing publicly with each other and it makes awkward politics with people who arent invited to participate for whatever reason this is a drop in club where anybody can go to jam and we dont always jive with each others styles  im looking for advice on howto handle the politics of the facilitation and feelings  i am also looking for advice about how to deal with the time issue i want to draw up a brief set of agreements that can guide the club which includes an agreement to start and finish on time but i dont want to do it all on my own because that seems dictatory i have tried twice to form a board of directors for the club and have only had a few takers i am considering calling a general meeting where everyone can attend but i also consider the time thing to be non negotiable i have worked very hard to get this club going i have produced professional workshops where i hired and arranged professional improvisors to come in i produced our fundraiser which took me 4 days found affordable practice space and have been there every week for consistency all because i just want to practice some improv i wanted 2 hours a week i can accept 150 but i didnt do all this to facilitate peoples need for social interaction how can i get them to understand that if 10 people start 15 minutes late we are wasting a cumulative 2 and a half hours  i am not a very good communicator and need a way to present this where people are open to listening and also hopefully agreeing any advice   dont know how to fix problems with casual weekly improv jam advice sought

I'm on a road trip up the west coast &amp; I just watched my first San Fran improv show and was FLOORED. I noticed that most LA improv is obsessed with finding the game and exploiting it (1,2,3 times then move on) whereas San Francisco improv is more about really becoming the character and building the relationships. Way deeper, richer, and smarter imo. (Also the improv scene in LA is swamped with dramatic actors looking for improv on their resume...

Anyway this is semi-relevant because I am about to move to Chicago, one of the main reasons being the improv there, but I don't know the scene at all.

Can anyone try to summarize how Chicago improv feels/ the philosophy at its core? How is it compared to LA or San Fran or any other big city?

So, I started my Improv journey in March by joining a 101 class. (and I just started 201). I've also been to quite a few jams, as well as auditions.

I do get laughs and complements, but I also reside in an extremely supportive environment, so I doubt their sincerity. I also feel that all the laughs that I get during the jams were either blind luck or low hanging fruit.

I'm constantly worried that I shouldn't be here, or that the next show, I won't be as lucky and it will be a mess. Worst of all, I'm afraid I'm not growing and I'll never be good enough to be in a troup.

Although I understand the problem with 'solving a problem' in a scene, I don't really understand the be less polite. 

I usually receive this note after playing something truthful: My partner is sick in a scene so I help them with soup or first aid: My partner trapped me in a dungeon so I freak out: My partner wants me to punch myself in the balls so I do even though my character doesn't want to. 

Any advice on this?

My sketch show recently had to change venues and unfortunately while we like our new place, the room really eats sound. We are thinking of getting body mics that we can wear while we do our sketches and improv. Do any of you guys have any experience with that/suggestions? We are thinking it would be nice to have at least 4 mics but obviously having more would be better.

We have about a grand in our fund that we only ever use for props, so we are fine with tapping into that a fair amount, but I know audio equipment can be really expensive so I don't really know if that's even enough.

Other notes are I have a large amplifier already. Thanks for any advice!

789,improv,"this is kind of a rant but i was talking to a friend's coach last night and i congratulated him on making it to a house team at one of the theaters in my city. he mentioned it took him a few years of auditioning to reach this point, but that his end goal would be to move to LA. i asked him why he didn't just pack up and move to LA before and he said he needed to put in his time at this theater (and in this city) before heading out.

i wanted to see if anyone on r/improv has struggled with and followed through on moving to a new city. why not just move to LA (or whatever your goal city is) and start there? there are so many performers from NY and chicago already teaching in LA that you'll be learning many different philosophies anyway. it just seems to me another case of being loyal to a theater instead of looking out for yourself. or am i missing something important? is anyone really judging anyone else if they don't ""put in enough time"" in a certain city or theater?","theater loyalty and ""putting in your time""","this is kind of a rant but i was talking to a friend's coach last night and i congratulated him on making it to a house team at one of the theaters in my city. he mentioned it took him a few years of auditioning to reach this point, but that his end goal would be to move to LA. i asked him why he didn't just pack up and move to LA before and he said he needed to put in his time at this theater (and in this city) before heading out.  i wanted to see if anyone on r/improv has struggled with and followed through on moving to a new city. why not just move to LA (or whatever your goal city is) and start there? there are so many performers from NY and chicago already teaching in LA that you'll be learning many different philosophies anyway. it just seems to me another case of being loyal to a theater instead of looking out for yourself. or am i missing something important? is anyone really judging anyone else if they don't ""put in enough time"" in a certain city or theater? theater loyalty and ""putting in your time""",this is kind of a rant but i was talking to a friends coach last night and i congratulated him on making it to a house team at one of the theaters in my city he mentioned it took him a few years of auditioning to reach this point but that his end goal would be to move to la i asked him why he didnt just pack up and move to la before and he said he needed to put in his time at this theater and in this city before heading out  i wanted to see if anyone on rimprov has struggled with and followed through on moving to a new city why not just move to la or whatever your goal city is and start there there are so many performers from ny and chicago already teaching in la that youll be learning many different philosophies anyway it just seems to me another case of being loyal to a theater instead of looking out for yourself or am i missing something important is anyone really judging anyone else if they dont put in enough time in a certain city or theater theater loyalty and putting in your time

Director would be a made move, because I'm just thinking laterally. 

Is that right?

Also, is it usually a case that you just think of a word or do you try and think of a whole scene at once?

804,improv,"hi everyone, I was at rehearsal today and there was something I find I have issues with.

so we were doing an exercise where one player does object work while the other gives verbal offer. the object work cannot be dismissed and must have some significance in the scene. the pkayer doing object work must more or less keep doing whatever activity they are doing without making the scene about the activity.

this is great because we are avoiding inventing or complicating things. instead we are jist working with minimal stuff.

the thing is, I guess only practice will make this better, but I find object work super distracting. when I was the person who was not doing object work, I found I was able to connect to my partner or make the scene forward.

my coach mentioned to commit to an emotion or react to what my partner is saying which does help, but the issue is often im too focused on the object work and activity to give honest reactions to my partner.

I really cant think of anything other than practice makes perfect, so if there are any other tips to do, id appreciate it.

I'm a noob and am just finishing a Level 1 couse at Toronto's Bad Dog Theater. I also started a Level A course at Second City Toronto because it's closer to home and they make you start at A so you're using their preferred method. 

Now I find that I like Bad Dog better, (SC feels a bit pretentious) but the Bad Dog feels like it might have limitations in growth compared to SC beyond beginner classes.

817,improv,"The team that I'm on has recently lost our regular coach. We have been rotating through many different options and are still deciding who we want to stick with. At our last practice we had a new coach that I wasn't that into. In my experience, a typical coach zeroes in on a particular skill to work on, takes you through some exercises to strengthen that one skill, then you do some sets. By the end of practice, everyone is feeling confident, and positive that the final set was the best/most polished. 

This is not what our last coach did. This coach gave very aimless and negative though valid notes throughout, but without any real solution to get us on the right track. When it came to our final set of the night, before we got to a crescendo, the coach stopped us mid-action and said something like ""are you guys planning on bringing everything together? There are only a few minutes left in the set. All the characters and events should become intertwined by the end."" This was not necessary as we were already on our way there, and the wind was taken out of our sails. Then instead of letting us do this big crescendo to our set, the coach said ""I don't need to see that, lets just get to the notes."" The whole practice left me feeling unsatisfied, and our team agrees not to bring this coach in again, but it left me wondering. Was this truly a bad coach or did we just not like the negative feedback? You don't want to feel like you're rejecting something just because it is maybe challenging you. Do coaches owe it to the teams they coach to make practice fun?

When it came to our final set of the night, before we got to a crescendo, the coach stopped us mid action and said something like ""are you guys planning on bringing everything together? There are only a few minutes left in the set. All the characters and events should become intertwined by the end."" This was not necessary as we were already on our way there, and the wind was taken out of our sails. Then instead of letting us do this big crescendo to our set, the coach said ""I don't need to see that, lets just get to the notes."" The whole practice left me feeling unsatisfied, and our team agrees not to bring this coach in again, but it left me wondering. Was this truly a bad coach or did we just not like the negative feedback? You don't want to feel like you're rejecting something just because it is maybe challenging you. Do coaches owe it to the teams they coach to make practice fun? Or is giving strong but productive criticism more important? Does practice need to be fun?",the team that im on has recently lost our regular coach we have been rotating through many different options and are still deciding who we want to stick with at our last practice we had a new coach that i wasnt that into in my experience a typical coach zeroes in on a particular skill to work on takes you through some exercises to strengthen that one skill then you do some sets by the end of practice everyone is feeling confident and positive that the final set was the bestmost polished   this is not what our last coach did this coach gave very aimless and negative though valid notes throughout but without any real solution to get us on the right track when it came to our final set of the night before we got to a crescendo the coach stopped us mid action and said something like are you guys planning on bringing everything together there are only a few minutes left in the set all the characters and events should become intertwined by the end this was not necessary as we were already on our way there and the wind was taken out of our sails then instead of letting us do this big crescendo to our set the coach said i dont need to see that lets just get to the notes the whole practice left me feeling unsatisfied and our team agrees not to bring this coach in again but it left me wondering was this truly a bad coach or did we just not like the negative feedback you dont want to feel like youre rejecting something just because it is maybe challenging you do coaches owe it to the teams they coach to make practice fun or is giving strong but productive criticism more important does practice need to be fun
818,improv,"These two guys do a show in New York called The Cheep Show. Musical improv, stand up comedy, and long form improv scenes. I found them through this subreddit and after watching one of their videos I reached out to them and invited them to come down to Palm Beach Florida for some sun. 

A partial lie, because I locked them in a theater all weekend and forced them to train students. They got some beach, but they have delicate skin and I can't have them burned!

They were two of the most professional, knowledgeable, and talented young men I have ever worked with. At just 25 years old they really impressed me with how well they got great work out of every student. 

Robert Price is a musical pro and had us singing improvised songs together as a group in minutes. 

Levi has what I can only describe as an intimidating level of theater knowledge and his insights into writing stand up was refreshing in a community that sadly has no leadership or direction in the stand up comedy world down here. 

These two showed us that you can use an improv approach to stand up and bring that same fun and excitement of improv into my comedy writing. 

If you want some teachers to come to your town and shake up the team, I highly recommend these two guys. I will certainly be inviting them back.

827,improv,"Hi there /r/improv!

I've created a website that aims to help improv/comedy minded people to exercise their comedic ability and get a better understanding about how well their jokes score. You can visit the site on [jokejudger.com](http://jokejudger.com).

A little introduction: I'm a student with a great passion for improv and currently researching computational humour (which is about how to generate humour with computers). For this research, I need quite some data, and thus I've created an online application called [JokeJudger](http://jokejudger.com). This application allows people to anonymously create jokes with challenges like in real improv and smart suggestions if necessary. Later, the website will show them the *(also anonymous)* ratings they've received for each joke using nice little graphs of the received scores.
This should allow people to get an honest view on how well their jokes score, without any of the classical biases we get on stage.

Currently, the joke form is limited to jokes in the form of ""I like my X like I like my Y, Z"", as this is a nice classic improv game, and should reduce the ""blank page syndrom"".

I hope you guys enjoy this site! I'd love to hear your feedback to make this application even better!

I am avoiding arguments though for this audition, but I want to know what about playing a character that dislikes the my partner's character?

would that be too negative for an audition?

this is assuming I'm not insulting my partner or being rude or yelling, which is obviously a big no no.


when I say negative, I mean more like status, and possibly passive aggressive and maybe occasional sarcasm. What does peeple here have to sai?

842,improv,"A few ways I believed it has helped me outside of performing (i.e. improvising itself, acting, theater, etc.).

- Expanded my range of expressions as you are forced act in ways you never have before (in a good way!)
- Injected spontaneity in my life
- ""Yes-And"" taught me to be more collaborative with people, be more synergistic, and accept/respect their ideas
- Taught me to be more present to the moment and relax
- Taught me to be a more active listener
- Humbled me and made me more ""coachable""
- Say ""Yes"" when I know what it is time to say ""Yes"" to something and act on it immediately
- Taught me to take more initiative and lead when I should
- Improved my social confidence and taught me that I could throw myself into awkward social situations that I thought I wasn't ready for and ""figure it out along the way"" and on the rare occasion I didn't, ""figure it out along the way,"" it was fine, and I was still alive

843,improv,"Hi,
I am going away for a month on vacation soon. I have an audition for another major theater in my city. I realized that in past experiences, if I haven't done improv in a month, I find I begin to become duller in scenes. It takes me a coupel of rehearsals to catch up.


So the thing is, my audition is like 2 weeks after I come back from vaacation. I know of two classes i can take in this time, and I might be able to get a rehearsal from my troupe, but I'm wondering if there are exercises or some way to improv by yourself?


there are no improv things happening where im vacationing unfortuantely.","keeping improv muscles worked, when you haven't performed in a long time?","Hi, I am going away for a month on vacation soon.

846,improv,"One thing I struggle with and have started to notice veteran improvisers do is playing a character at the top of the scene and holding onto that character throughout the scene. I posted about this a week ago where I usually feel like I have nothing in a scene if I don't have a game.. 

I would say 9 out of 10 scenes I come out as myself or maybe me with a little excitement. But I have so many characters that I never play! I'm a very physical comedian. And I don't mean characters that I have in my back pocket-  but making up physical characters by adjusting my posture or voice, and I can feel it really give me something. A POV. Something to filter my thoughts through. 

I rarely have the balls to play a character In a scene. I usually just walk in with an idea not a character and just play myself with an initiation. And if i do walk in with a character I usually end up dropping this character after a couple lines.

Any recommendations on a class/school that would help with this?

He is currently known as ""Old Man Improv"" in Canada and he is the co-founder of Canada's largest theatre festival, the Canadian Improv Games. David Shepherd founded the Compass Players, and co-founder Second City and the Canadian Improv Games 40 years ago!

I am a highschool improvisor who has competed with my boyfriend this year with the first two-man troupe in CIG! (A typical team has five to nine or ten players) For those wondering, we ranked first in Toronto Regional Finals, advanced to the National games, and ranked 6th of all 500 competing schools in Canada! (Yay!) This garnered a lot of attention, a couple interviews, but most of all the eye of Howard Jerome. 

On the first day, Howard sought us out in the crowd at an event we were all attending. He asked for a video with us to send to David, congratulating us, and celebrating our ballsy-ness. I was so star struck in that moment. 

Later that week, the games are over and we are packed up and scooting out of the hotel, Howard stops us and asks us and our coach to David Shepherd's hotel room. 

We hightail it up there, and get to talk to, and be congratulated by one of the founders of all North American Improv. All the while Howard is telling us we are Elaine May and Mike Nichols (original compass players and famous comedy duo as taught by David) reincarnated. My boyfriend also gets told he's cute. David gives us his card, asks us to send him any videos of us performing we have online, and we shakehands. 

Little to say I will remember their encouragement, investment in the little guys, and kindness for the rest of my life.

852,improv,"Hey! Myself (Robert Taylor) and a buddy (Matthew Bauckman, co-director of the film ""Kung-fu Elliot"") host a podcast called B-Roll. It's a mix between Cool Games Inc and Film Reroll. Each week we come up with three movie titles and synopses and the other person picks their favourite. After that, we roll a D20 to decide its genre, plot points and tropes in the film. It's a comedy/film/improv podcast and we need your help!

We've been coming up with our own suggestions or using a random word generator but would love to get the Reddit community involved in helping us curate some dumb film titles and loglines. Submissions don't have to be long and you can follow the format:

**FILM TITLE**

**LOGLINE**

As simple as that. Eventually we would love to always include listener suggestions and we will credit every submission used in the show. Had a dumb idea for a movie that you'll never get round to writing? Submit it to us and we'll have a crack at it. Bill Murray in a biopic about the life of Steve Buscemi? Why not? You submit it and we'll work with what we get. Just give us a flavour of what the film is about and we'll work from there.

Here are some examples of the films we've already ""*created*"" to give you an idea of the type of thing we do:

Episode 009: Memory Bank - sci-fi thriller, Minority Report meets Memento starring Owen Wilson.

Episode 008: A Murder Most Foul - Ray Charles investigates the murder of JFK as he was the only one to smell the culprit.

Episode 004: Cher This Dance With Me - an inaccurate musical biopic on the life of Cher.

Episode 003: Night Caring - a Knight of the realm is mean to everybody he meets until cursed by a fairy to become nice. Starring DMX and a fairy that lives by snorting cocaine. It's a kid's film.

In a relationship scene   with no game  how do you play it?,i know all the schools dont focus on game but its something that has helped me build better scenes the past few months   i did a scene a couple nights ago that my teacher said was a relationship scene i was a son who was embarassed by my mom being a vacuum salesperson and not a cool mom the scene was between us two   i couldnt really find a game to play so i felt very stuck in the scene my teacher said there wasnt a game it was just a relationship scene so how do you play a scene when you cant find the unusual thing to heighten what should you focus on when you have established the who what and where  in a relationship scene   with no game  how do you play it

881,improv,"Hi

I'm DM-ing a Fate Core game. The rules are meant for collaborative play, meaning that the players can -- and are meant to -- have a say in background info and how some of the action goes. Ideally it should go like directed improv with me as the GM providing the backbone of the Story, the less the cooler.

Problem is, I may have underestimated how hard this would be for non-improvisers. We've been going through character creation and I've been noticing my players having great difficulty to commit to ideas and going with the flow, yes-anding and so on. They're easily paralyzed with choice, trying to get everything ""perfect"".

I don't want to scare them with physical exercises or scene work, so here's the question: 

What are some good exercises to get my players to let go of trying to perfectly nail down everything up front and make them less afraid of making up stuff as it comes up, just going with their first impulse? Maybe also playing characters that aren't what they started out thinking they were. 

As I said, preferrably verbal exercises because I don't want to overwhelm them, but I'm grateful for all ideas.

885,improv,"Hey Improvisers,

I'm a novice improviser with 18 weeks of classes at a local theater that trains under the Annoyance style. We had our first showcase last night in front of a crowd that paid to see a comedysportz match--we did a montage long form show for 8 min right before intermission.

I went into the performance feeling weirdly relaxed. I felt like I knew what I had to do: establish a POV, connect a relationship with my scene partner, interact with the environment, heighten. All of that somewhat went out the window when we got our suggestion and fear of the audience's expectations set in.

The first scene I was in, we established that we were graduating seniors in a locker room after our last big match of the season. I established myself as a now aimless jock. My personal game was football was the only thing I was good at and now I would be disappointed with only being average. My scene partner and I kind of floundered around talking about how terrible we were at odd jobs and our football career being over. Then, My scene partner offered that he was in love with me and he fully committed to a confessional with tears and everything. I panicked. Another teammate third-ed in as the coach delivered a line about finding us jobs and the scene was cut. The audience's response was pretty cold throughout the scene. We had a few chortles when we talked about how badly our character's lives outside of football were and it became dead silent after the confessional.

The move wasn't totally unexpected--we had been playing around with being in love with each other during practice, but someone was usually playing a girl character. I'm also actually gay, but the character I had in my head was straight. The only thing I could think about in the moment was what would the audience think/want and I feared that was in conflict with what I would want as a person and how my character would respond. So, I just bailed.

In hindsight, I could have had some fun plays off of the gift like discovering that he had been leaving love notes in my locker, or realizing I'd been touching his butt during games for the last four years, ect. Instead, fear won and I just wanted off stage.

The rest of the show went okay. I didn't make any big choices after that scene, but I was able to support and set up some good scenes. At the after party, we got a positive response from our coach and some of the other improvisers in the professional troupe.

The general guidance I've gleaned from improv blogs is that failing is part of the process and you just need to keep getting back up. Should I talk to my team about what happened or is it more of a personal insecurity I need to deal with? There's a decent probability we will be together for another 8 wk class and showcase.

Do you consider audience reactions at all when improvising long form? Or, do you double down on committing to your choice regardless?

Thanks for reading!

Then, My scene partner offered that he was in love with me and he fully committed to a confessional with tears and everything. I panicked. Another teammate third ed in as the coach delivered a line about finding us jobs and the scene was cut. The audience's response was pretty cold throughout the scene. We had a few chortles when we talked about how badly our character's lives outside of football were and it became dead silent after the confessional.  The move wasn't totally unexpected  we had been playing around with being in love with each other during practice, but someone was usually playing a girl character. I'm also actually gay, but the character I had in my head was straight. The only thing I could think about in the moment was what would the audience think/want and I feared that was in conflict with what I would want as a person and how my character would respond. So, I just bailed.  In hindsight, I could have had some fun plays off of the gift like discovering that he had been leaving love notes in my locker, or realizing I'd been touching his butt during games for the last four years, ect. Instead, fear won and I just wanted off stage.  The rest of the show went okay. I didn't make any big choices after that scene, but I was able to support and set up some good scenes. At the after party, we got a positive response from our coach and some of the other improvisers in the professional troupe.  The general guidance I've gleaned from improv blogs is that failing is part of the process and you just need to keep getting back up. Should I talk to my team about what happened or is it more of a personal insecurity I need to deal with? There's a decent probability we will be together for another 8 wk class and showcase.  Do you consider audience reactions at all when improvising long form? Or, do you double down on committing to your choice regardless?  Thanks for reading!

894,improv,"Hello everyone!
My partner and I just had our first twoprov practice with a coach, and our most consistent feedback was that we need to get to the unusual thing faster and heighten more. Our scenes were grounded and top-of-intelligence, maybe too much so--it took a lot of slow building to get to something unusual. 

I struggle with the balance between wanting to be grounded and wanting to get funnier--I can see that our scenes are moving too slowly but I feel reluctant to force a big character choice. 

I'm also wondering if part of the problem is our opening--we've done organic openings and also a deconstruction, and I've always had a much easier time with premise-based like a monologue or even pattern game. With those, I can walk into the scene with an unusual thing in mind and try to create a character around that, instead of starting with a character and trying to come up with an unusual thing. 

This is a little unfocused, but I'm curious to hear if any of you have struggled with something similar or found any warmups/exercises that helped with this kind of thing.

928,improv,"Hi everyone! As the title implies, I recently had my team accepted for the Del Close Marathon and I want to thank the subreddit for the continued inspiration. This is where the ""sob story"" starts, so if you don't wanna hear the story, that's all I wanted to say. I'm so happy to be able to go to New York and probably perform at 5 A.M. 

The Reason For The Excitement:
I know for some improvisers, DCM might not be a big deal to get into, but for a college student from Ohio, this is a big deal. What makes it even more exciting for me is that I go to a large school that has two fairly good improv teams, and I had gotten rejected from both teams four times after having tried out each semester. After all the rejection, I joined our schools humor magazine and decided that I would never be good at improv. After starting a sketch comedy group with the people in the magazine, some of us decided to try and make an improv team, with the goal being performing at DCM. After a month of intense training consisting of 40 minute disasters of long forms and no idea how you train for improv, we did a performance for our friends  and sent that footage out, feeling that there was no way a mediocre team from Ohio would make the cut. 

The reason I thank the subreddit is because after each rejection, I would not even want to think about improv. But, everyday I would look at Reddit, and I would see a post from r/improv. Sometimes they would just be random theatre questions, but sometimes they would be improvisers doubting themselves. Seeing that other people who, if I saw them perform, I would consider them to be in the improv scene, have the same feelings that I did helped me continuously peruse improv despite the setbacks.

934,improv,"Hi Improv,
Have around 6 months of improv experience, played in 10-13 shows. 
Couple of weeks ago I (by absolute chance) did improvised stand-up, 10 minute set.  Have never done anything like it before, showed up to see the show, friend asked to replace last minute flake and I gave it a go.
It was very low stakes, because even if I failed, nobody (including me) expected anything. I had no experience and wasn't even familiar with the format of the show.  


That's why I had a lot of fun. The problem that it went really well. I had some offers to do it again, more seriously, but now I am scared shitless. 
I feel like my first time was just blind luck and I simply can't top the jokes that i came up at that moment. The stakes are much higher now, some people ask me to perform, others tell how good and funny I was and literally pushing me to do it again.


I am seriously, honestly afraid of failing miserably, more then I ever been before. Even  at my second show in my life, when 12 performers out of 16 bailed, and 4 of us had to go on for 50 minutes instead of 10, I was scared to my bones but still not as much.


I am at my wits end, don't know what to do and how to deal with the situation.


Any advice will be highly appretiated.

* if we let him finish talking, then reply, then he will continue talking non stop after in responsr to our response.

I truly believe that long form's biggest hurdle is its inability to really involve the audience. One suggestion at the top, and then that's it? Why not give the audience the power to have direct, immediate input over the improv they would like to see? That's why I am proud to announce *the Xavier,* my new signature form.

It works like this: The improv team takes the stage and, after about a minute, says to the audience ""the suggestion is..."" and they say whatever word comes to mind. That's where the improv begins: The team does *nothing* while the audience imagines exactly what they would like to see the team do. All edits, all game moves, everything, is completely in the hands and *minds* of the audience! Truly anything is possible in the Xavier!

Some years ago during a troupe rehearsal there was a scene where I chose to be a duck. I thought it was fine, but after the scene our director told me not to be an animal again because according to her ""animals aren't characters and watching someone squawk isn't interesting."" 


I left the troupe mainly for other reasons, but this particular incident has left me hesitant about trying improv again. In my opinion humans are animals, and other animals are as complex as humans, so there's no reason why communication with them can't be as engaging. I recall not speaking with words, exactly, but I did do varied vocalizations and movements and facial expressions, and my scene partner, who played a human, had no trouble playing off of me. 


I feel like I was told not to act a particular age, or gender, or profession, or ethnicity, or emotion, just because a particular age, or gender, or profession, or ethnicity, or emotion isn't interesting, which is of course untrue. Are werewolves also not okay? What about ghosts? What about robots? What about some random mythical creature invented on the spot? I get that sometimes people may continuously fall back on a stereotyped role because they're afraid to venture into something new, but it was the first and only time, as far as I recall, in several weeks of being in that group, that I was a non-human. I am reluctant now to return to improv, even though I really miss it, because it seems to me that a healthy aspect of my spontaneity is, well, not allowed. Like I have to keep some kind of arbitrary rule in my head not to do something. I can accept rules if they make sense to me but this one doesn't.

989,improv,"I just thought of a different way I'd like to approach game and it's making me curious about what everyone else thinks.  I'd like to hear other ideas about how you find a funny idea in a scene and how you continue to keep the scene funny to an audience. 

This is based on my own experience and may not be true for everyone.  Sorry in advanced for my writing's rabbit-hole tendencies.

When I first heard of the concept of ""letting go of your own ideas on stage,"" I thought it equivocated to ""don't be a bully.""  Although listening and acknowledging your partner's ideas is vital to a scene, I don't believe those tips fully encapsulate ""letting go of your own ideas.""

Ask them if they thought the scene was funny *while they were in it* and they will still say no.  The game and the funny is there no matter what because it's the relationship between the improvisers that makes me laugh. If you and your partner both give in to the game, you'll come out feeling better than if you both are focused on playing the game.

1002,improv,"New to the sub here.

I have always wanted to try and learn some comedy pointers, so this year after leaving a job that kept me from voicing any opinions in a public forum, I decided to test the water a bit. I started with an improv class and was hooked on it immediately. Flash forward and I am now on two indie teams and can't get enough stage time, it is addicting.  I learn something new every time like timing, beats, stage confidence and most importantly ignoring the bombs and moving on immediately.  

Recently I joined a stand up workshop, started working on a 5 min set and hitting a mic.  That has been scary and great at the same time. Scary because at mics, nobody laughs because they are all there to work on their stuff, so it is kind of a competition environment I guess. The great part is it is MY voice and I can try anything I want to as opposed to improv which is more PG-13 most nights.  My standup humor is a tad darker than my improv teammates so this is a good way to try shit without pissing off a theater of vacationers expecting to see an improv scene about bigfoot eating a pizza in space.

any format that gives room for story development and character development is great. just no more harold. I think we have had enough :)

to give an idea, there was a format I saw where there is a panel of filmmalers who pitch an idea for a film, then act out certain scenes in front of producers, who then will give edits for the filmamkers to improve. the filmmakers will act oit scenes again with changes.

1035,improv,"I'm looking to start an indie night in my city (Edmonton, Canada) and could certainly use some insight and help. First some details then some questions:

The city has a good improv community - at least two strong, successful improv companies and some others on the rise. As it stands there are no indie nights in the city and I've never been to one, only read about them online, so I'm kinda in the dark on specifics. 

I'd like to start an indie night as a place where improvisors can try new teams and formats but also bridge the gap between the existing companies and strengthen the community. So have some questions about how indie nights are typically run and looking for any opinions on them.

-Is there any vetting process for who performs?
-What's a typical venue for indie nights (bar, theater space, just anything)?
-What's a common night for an indie night (total length, time per troupe)?
-Straight up: are they any good?

1057,improv,"Just to provide some context.

I'm from Australia and I've been taking improv classes for the past 8 weeks in a level 1 class. I just performed my first improv showcase last night and I left a little disappointed.

Now, I probably wasn't that bad, but I think I could have done a lot better and I do usually set unnecessary high standards for myself.

So, I think the biggest reason I didn't perform as well as I could have was nerves. I've never performed in my life, and I was definitely feeling nervous before and during the showcase. I was also disappointed because I felt like the past few weeks before the showcase, I was really satisfied with how well I was going during the classes. And the reason for that was because after 5 classes (5 weeks), I started to loosen up, relax, be comfortable around my classmates, not panic (so much) in practice scenes or even in a ""yes and"" game and just started to have fun with it.

So my question is, how can I fast track myself to that feeling of relaxation on stage (and even in classes)? Of course it will come after experience, the more I practice and do classes and shows, but is there anymore I can do?

I've also passed level 1 and doing level 2 this week, and I think I will also go through the usual routine of panic and anxiety, because I will be in a class full of people I do not know. So I don't want to have to wait until week 5 of 8 until I start feeling comfortable. I want that as soon as I can.

Cheers for any advice.

I know about the Upfront and will likely be going to their drop in class on Saturday to test the waters but I would love to hear your experiences with this or any of the other local funny huts.

1082,improv,"(skip to '***' for the abridged version)

Let me be clear. Improv fucks with me like nothing else that I do.

I have lived the last 10 years of my life in a self-critical bubble of negativity and low self-esteem. There is no way in hell I could have seen myself doing improv 1.5 years ago.

At that point, I picked up improv for just one purpose: to be comfortable in my own skin.
     To me, improv was a place to practice that. Improv was to get me out of my shell. Improv was the means to self-confidence.

I am in college and I am on two improv teams (15 members each) - both with different styles. One of my teams draws crowds of up to 100 every week, and most people would assume that I'm a star player. However, I just keep getting stuck in my head all the time. I compare myself to other players on my teams and I get self-conscious, wondering why I can't do what they do (think quickly and creatively with confidence).
     Every time I go to practice or a show, I have to take a minute to prepare myself. I try to be loose, confident, and talkative. I'm not that way, but I want to be. I TRY. I sometimes am successful, but most of the time, I am not who I want to be.
     Every time I feel dissapointed about a practice or a performance, I try to reassure myself that this is a process. I want to be who I truly am, but I'm stuck in my shell still. Sometimes I come out, most of the time I don't. That is why improv has been a challenge for me.

***Anyway, that's the emotional garbage I've got for you. But let's talk strategies.

My major problems:
1) low confidence
2) slow cognition
3) lack of creativity

My solutions, respectively:
1)
-attack the stage, trust yourself and your team, be a little reckless.
-open up to my teammates about the challenges I face.
-tell my negative self-talk to shut up.
2)
-read some books. I haven't finished an entire book in 4 years. Instead I read academic jargon for school.
-Maybe do a 15 minute freewrite before practice to get my brain in gear.
-keep up with meditation regularly. I've been trying, but I'm not consistent
-get sleep, eat healthy, and exercise (try to get endorphins before improv)
3)
-Do some creative writing. I have never done that ever. One of my ideas is to just write down everything new that I learn and somehow incorporate that into a creative writing piece.

I already know what I need to do. I need to attack the stage. I need to HAVE FUN. I need to relax. I need to be vulnerable. I need to think positively.

Secondly- is this an entirely different style of improv? Can you use premise based improv within organic improv or are they two separate types of improv?

I've been doing improv for a couple years and I'm pretty happy with the progress I've made.
When I started, I was so anxious I felt like I was having panic attacks the first 4 classes I took. Now I perform fairly often and do alright.

The one thing I can't seem to do is think and feel at the same time, as fucking weird as that sounds. If I let myself react emotionally to what is happening in the scene, I can stay present and react to things organically, but I miss a lot of stuff that could be used to heighten the scene and I forget information that I and my scene partner said. Essentially I miss the stuff that makes the difference between a scene between two people, and a show with a theme that repeats (the latter of which, I go nuts for.)

When I hear things that spark the ""aha! I know what's happening here"" feeling I can play them but it feels stilted and the audience lets me know that it's funny enough for some trepidatious laughs, but not enough to really make them care about what they're watching.

1101,improv,"Here is my dissertation on why Objection is a superior game, what a good run of Objection looks like in a shortform show, and what it can teach an improviser.

But first, introductions. Hey! I do amateur improv in Nottingham, England, generally shortform and games. I like taking games apart and figuring out why they're helpful, and what makes a 'good' run of a particular game. I'm sure ""Why I Like the Game ___"" will be a popular and long-running series of posts.

### Objection

Objection as defined by my uni group is a game where 6 players get into 2 teams with the goal of recounting something to a judge. Often we take a task from the audience and the teams recount that. One team will be performing at once, and the other team watches them for either internal inconsistencies or things that don't make sense. When this happens the player who noticed it will say objection, and explain the contradiction to the judge. If sustained, that team will take over the telling of the tale.

For me, when this game is well-played it *looks* competitive. At first the teams have quite reasonable objections. ""He's walked right over the hole he dug!"" Then as the scene goes on, the stakes are raised by having more frequent, pettier objections.  ""Objection! He's wearing glasses! Objection! I was standing further to the left!"" Great stuff.

### What it trains

For new improvisers this game trains you not to deny the base reality of a scene, but as a more experienced improviser it has turned into a far more collaborative affair. This game doesn't look like it's emphasising collaboration, but just last week I found myself intentionally contradicting what I'd said so the other team could pick up on it. The team not performing is in charge of all the punchlines, so the team on stage is in charge of setting them up. So when you no longer accidentally mess up so often, you have to purposefully mess up.

It also trains listening. The players not performing are actively listening for something to call attention to, which is a vital collaborative skill. In the context of this game, contradicting a scene partner constitutes building on their idea. The improviser who listens for something, finds it, and makes a joke about it feels pretty good because they advanced the scene and looked like they got one over on the other team. The game is structured such that active listening is rewarded.

So to close, Objection is a great way to teach improvisers that they're in this together, even when they're on opposite teams.",Why I Like the Game Objection,"Here is my dissertation on why Objection is a superior game, what a good run of Objection looks like in a shortform show, and what it can teach an improviser.

I am around two years in to improv and just having fun. I tried out and made it on to a “house team” for a theater/school in a decent sized city (yea!). I was thinking it meant regular rehearsals and performances for about four months (two solid of practices followed by two of practices and performances). It has turned into rehearsals for a few months, when the coach can make it, and one show a month, with a commitment in the nine-month open-ended may-go-sooner-or-longer range. Is this as ad hoc as it sounds? 

So: What is the commitment for a house team in your area? What does that mean for practice an performance?

Thanks.

Sure, groups often do a warm-up together, but is there anything that you do personally, as an individual, to prepare yourself mentally or physically for performance?

I myself do not have a routine other than to stretch out my face a little bit. I don't necessarily make silly faces for the duration of my performance, but I find that stretching my facial muscles helps me to prepare: I open my eyes as wide as I can and squint them hard, and I stretch my jaw and lips to their extremities. With the eyes, I feel it helps my facial expression. With the mouth, I feel it helps my enunciation as well as facial expression.

Sometimes I listen to music to psych myself out a little bit, but not always. I do find that a little time alone helps me to perform, even though I am part of an ensemble.

1136,improv,"I've been doing improv since 2012. If you take away the short breaks I've had, I've been doing improv for a little more than 4 years now. Most of it long-form. I've just started doing some coaching and I want to start teaching classes at my current theater. I am very passionate about teaching and coaching improv.

Recently, an opportunity came up where I might be able to move to Chicago. This last summer I did the 5 week intensive at iO and really enjoyed it. I loved Chicago and the improv there was incredibly inspiring. The experience truly changed the way I play and approach improv.

However, this would be the third time I've moved cities and had to start over at a new theater. Its frustrating because I know if I make the move (especially to Chicago), I won't teach or coach for quite some time even though I think I have the experience necessary to at the very least coach. I'd love going through classes again but am worried that since I'm starting over I may not be able to have the almost weekly performing opportunities I do now. And while I most certainly believe that you can always learn more, I definitely think at this point I'd prefer to have more shows over even more classes.

I will say that I think my end-game goal is to eventually open up my own theater (most likely NOT in Chicago). Having extensive training and experience in Chicago improv would be an awesome credential to have. Obviously, this is a long term kind of goal. Maybe 5-10 years out.

I'm just kind of torn. And I don't really know what the right move is. Most people I hear that move to Chicago do it when they are about 1-2 years deep into improv. And I'm at least double that in experience. It also seems like a lot of people move away from Chicago to LA or something once they get some experience to try to find acting work. That's not a big deal to me because while I'd love to be a working actor, I'm definitely more passionate towards the art of improv itself. While I wouldn't hesitate to accept an offer to be on SNL its not really a 'goal' of mine and I'm more interested in just getting better and making improv BIGGER.

1151,improv,"I am a long time reddit and /r/improv lurker but I finally created an account to pose a question for all of you- any help is greatly appreciated. I have been performing long form improv in a small city (Dayton, OH) for about a year now (I realize this is basically no experience in the grand scheme of performing) and my buddy and I would like to make a leap and move to one of the bigger cities to pursue a career in comedy (improv classes, sketch writing, actor, sitcom writing, standup, etc). My question has mainly to do with the cities I am considering. New York seems to be a favorite as well as Chicago and I know a lot of the positives of moving to either one. For reasons I won’t get into, there are a few small factors (independent of improv and comedy) that lean towards choosing Atlanta. 

Does anyone perform in Atlanta and/or can anyone speak to the city’s improv and comedy scene in general? I have heard a few things about it being an up and coming city for the film industry specifically and through searches I’ve found there to be a handful of improv theaters as well. I get that New York, Chicago, LA would be the ideal places but I somewhat wonder about any saturation of performers pursuing these careers there and wonder if you could stand out more in a city like Atlanta. That is, only if there is a good amount of comedy, film and otherwise, happening there.

I’ve found this old thread to be quite helpful but any unique input would be great. Also this thread is 8 months old, things may have changed.

1153,improv,"Hi there,

My goal is to move to Chicago in about a year. I was curious if you all could help me answer a few questions about the city itself and Improvising in it. 

A little about me, I'm a 20 year old male (Will be 21 when i move) and have been Improvising for 6 years a mix of high school and the local team. I'll have my AA and about 10k in savings. Improv is one of my passions and the main reason I'll be moving. 

 Questions are,

What part of town should I look to live in/look to avoid?

What's the Best/Worst thing about living in Chicago?

If you also moved to the city from elsewhere, How was your experience? What would you do differently?
 
How's the Weather? (Ill be coming from Florida and enjoy the 2 cold&amp;rainy days we have each year.)

Are the different theater's somewhat centralized or spread out all over the city?

What theater would you personally recommend going to first if my goal is to strengthen my improv as much as possible? (Also if there's a theater you don't recommend)

How often can one perform once they get involved (Weekly? Monthly?) 

Compared to NY how expensive is the city?

Literally anything else i should know about Chicago/Improv there?

1169,improv,"We are a group of relatively new performers, all over 50, with less than 2 years experience in improv. We got together last summer with 8 members. We wanted to be a Harold troupe, and started working towards that goal in our weekly practices. After a couple of confusing, frustrating rehearsals, and some weak performances, we shit-canned the Harold and simply went to doing a montage of scenes.

One of the things we liked about the Harold was the way it opened: with an invocation, or a word association - something totally different than just getting an audience suggestion and going from that suggestion only.

So our show is now a montage, with a single monologue opening - one of our members will step forward and do a 2-3 minute monologue based on an audience suggestion. The monologue gives us lots to work with for our show. Since this is still relatively new to us, sometimes the way the monologue starts is kind of clumsy - we'll all check in with each other to make sure we're not stepping on toes before just jumping up front. (we've been told that we're 'too polite')

We switched to a new coach in November. The new coach and her husband are well respected in our community, are in several troupes, tight with the owners and staff, and have a long history there. They compliment each other as coaches, in that if one can't make rehearsal, the other one can, and they share notes. They have slightly different coaching styles, but one is not better or worse than the other. 

Cut to rehearsal yesterday: this is our first rehearsal with our new coach in 3 weeks (both she and husband were away, so we had a sub for the last two weeks).

We had an effective 1-1/2 hours of rehearsal, exercises, etc. Near the end, as she was summarizing, we asked us how we felt about our show overall. We all agreed that we need work, but we're comfortable with the way things are going.

She then began to tell us how poor the monologue opening is for us, and how a poor monologue will lead to a poor show. We should immediately TRASH the monologue, not work on it anymore, and do something else. 

** NOTE ** she or her husband have never ever SEEN our show, nor have we done a full run with a monologue in rehearsals. They've only seen notes from others. 

We told her that we wanted to keep the monologue, and work on it. She wouldn't have it, and in the end, the discussion became kind of heated. One of our members left the room to cool off and not say something he'd regret. She took that as ""disrespectful"" and in the end, quit the troupe. 

This discussion all went downhill very quickly, and none of us could figure out what the hell had just happened. We decided to give it a day, and then approach her to come back.

She quit again via instant messenger before we could do that, affirming her decision.

So are we wrong to want to fix this? We don't want to have a reputation in our community as being argumentative. We don't want other coaches to avoid us, and still want to get booked and get shows. But but we also want to do a show that we want to do. 

Is it unreasonable to ask for A and expect A and not B?

I have been on a college improv, sketch, and stand-up group for three years now. But I want to try something new in an over-shadowed city. I want to try to create an improv // comedy space. Yeah. That's a lofty goal... right?

But the real question I have is how about making it happen. Most of you who may comment will probably say for me to get experience in a well-established improv comedy theatre. But, my budding idealistic millennial mind says ""I want to do it now"".

Obviously I have to start small -- maybe find a bar that allows comedy shows and try to do a weekly/monthly shows. I have the connections to make that happen. But my goal includes a performance space, and classes for the public. I am not looking to turn a profit. Any thoughts? Build me up and/or tear me apart.

Naturally, people have popped up (myself included) to say it's not important. To elaborate: from my point of view, there are more important and more useful things to focus on in the first few lines. 

I feel like there's a disconnect here on what that means. Certainly, we all agree *specifics* are important—it's not a good idea to have vague people doing nothing in Limboland. But at the same time, the instruction sounds as though it's divorced from the rest of the scene—as if to robotically say ""We have established the information, now we may commence with the scene.""

I also feel the three-line-rule to be artificial and panic-inducing. Who cares if I called you ""Dad"" or said ""Home Depot"" at the *fifth* line? At the same time, there are diminishing returns if you withhold from labeling things far into a scene. How can we reconcile this into something more productive?

1202,improv,"I just got kicked out of my improv group earlier today. 

The reasons for it is that there is a disconnect between myself and the group--with style, scheduling, etc. But also with group members being absolutely uncomfortable with me. 

Long story short, I have depression. As of writing this, I am doing fine. The last time I had a relapse was back in the summer time. The last couple of shows we had, I kept beating myself up. None of them really helped me out or asked if I was okay. And with our last show, in early DEC, I felt awesome! We really clicked.

But along the way, depression got the best of me. I was in bad moods, said some stupid stuff, emotional, being burnt out...there is a lot to unpack. I have no problem with addressing it if anyone was curious. But at this given moment, I've never felt better about myself. There were bumps along the way, but I am feeling good!

I found out today through an email that the group decided to kick me out. This was a little bit of a shock, especially on how it was written, but I also wasn't that surprised. The disconnect and the groups uncomfortable feelings for me really killed it. I recognized it awhile ago, but I never had time to acknowledge it because of school/work/other shows.

I wrote all of them back an email saying how disappointed I am and wished that we could've talked this out, but explained that this was the right call. Along with apologizes for the things that I did unintentionally, I said it was an honor to share the stage and wished them the best of luck.

I want to know, if this has happen to anyone, how do you deal with being kicked out of the group? What is the best advice? Its something that I don't think is talked about often, but I'd love to know what you think.

EDIT: When I meant by being ""burnt out"", I was doing A LOT. I was working in the mornings, going to school, acting in shows...I was pulling 12-14 hour days and I would cap it off with improv rehearsals. Thus making me really tired/cranky and the complete opposite of who I am. That isn't depression, it is just being exhausted as balls.

&gt; Hello....

&gt; You may already be aware of a difficult and sad decision we had to make a couple days ago regarding AnnoyanceNY.  A number of factors have come together at this time which have made it necessary to close our Bedford Ave. space on March 31st.  

&gt; WTF????

&gt; yeah.

&gt; Never a happy thing to have to send an announcement like this.  BUT...it's not all bad news. First, we have a solid 2 months to go out with a bang with all our shows, finish the next round of classes, and also host a workshop with Mick before we close the doors.  AND...we are exploring other possibilities in Brooklyn.  YOU might know of some place we don't, that would be perfect...a place where we can be properly licensed and ADA accessible and easy to get to. If you DO....  please let us know.  Or you might know someone who you think would be a great help. If you DO... please let us know.

&gt; This is a really hard choice - especially because we're really proud of what is going on there. You've all been a part of a wonderful community and we get such amazing, positive feedback about the shows, the people and the place.  

&gt; WHAT CAN YOU DO?

&gt; Keep your eyes and ears open, and let us know about any opportunities you hear about.  

&gt; Keep coming to shows and taking classes. The stronger we are on the way out, the more chance we have at coming back. 

&gt; Tell people about The Annoyance! The more great buzz we have, the better we look to a potential landlord or partner.

1212,improv,"I love improv.

I believe the first three lines are the most important part of an improv show.  My favorite exercise, one I employ before every show, is where everyone on the troupe cycles through two-person, three-line scenes to get one quick refresher on the fundamentals before we go on stage.  

Here’s what I look for in a three-line scene:

The first line is the initiation, where the actor with an idea gives the idea to the team.

 In the second line, an improviser responds, indicating they heard the reality, they agree, and then adds something to the reality.  

The third line accepts the addition to the reality, then builds off of it.  

In this essay, I’m going to break down a very successful scene’s first three lines to show how two expert improvisers use the beginning of this scene to set the tone for a whole show, and why this first interaction is so important.  This is intended to help someone with no background in improvisation get a glimpse “behind the scene,” and give an idea of how an improviser thinks when they’re creating. 

Before I get to that, I want to quickly say I don’t think there’s a single recipe for good improv.  Take everything with a grain of salt.  I’ve seen amazing improv that breaks all the “rules.”  I’ve seen tepid, boring improv that did everything an improv team is supposed to do.  However, I think that all good improv has some characteristics in common:  collaboration, playfulness, commitment, and CROWS.  CROWS is an anagram I was taught that stands for Character, Relationship, Objective, Where, and Story. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ_B_oxh3lY

This is the best improv scene I’ve seen on YouTube.  It’s by a team called Fuck That Shit.  I love this scene, and want to explain why I love this scene.

Fuck That Shit’s work always involves strong CROWS and an insane degree of commitment to the reality of their scenes.  You can tell from watching them that they are just having a ball on stage, and the audience soaks that in.  

Also, I never see them argue or stump each other, which is a pet peeve I have.  I think when people pay to see an improv team they pay to watch strangers work together, not point out each others mistakes for cheap laughs.

Now to the scene itself.  They get the variable “Wiccan.”  This show starts in a two-person scene, which is something I advocate because the lack of additional players allows the two performers to focus completely on setting the reality they are playing on.  

The first line of this scene by Fuck That Shit is the best initiation I’ve ever heard.

AARON JACKSON:  Okay, this is going to be a real séance this time, okay?  None of your bullshit.

There’s a lot of great things going into this initiation.  He took the variable, internalized it, and turned it into an idea.  We know that this guy is trying to contact the dead, and we know that he’s tried to do this before, but was spoiled by some “bullshit” from the other person in this scene.  So, in two sentences, Jackson established three of the elements from CROWS.  
**   Character.  Jackson established his character is someone who believes it’s possible to contact the dead.   

*  Relationship.  He is in the scene with another believer who spoiled the last attempt. 
*  Objective.  We know the characters are trying to hold a séance.  

Now let’s look at the second line.

KATE ZELENSKY:  Janice, the last time I went into diabetic shock.

Kate is doing everything you want your scene partner to do.  She listened, accepted, and built. There’s a lot of great work going into this line.

1.	She named Aaron’s character “Janice.”  This further establishes the relationship between Kate’s character and Aaron’s.

2.	Look how she focused on what her partner was saying, and asked herself, “what could he possibly be referring to?”  But instead of asking Aaron to clarify, she does the work and answers the question for him, supplying a backstory.  She explained the “bullshit” brought up by Janice.  In two lines, we already have an idea of the backstory between these two characters.  Backstory is very important in improv.  It’s hard to make compelling scenes between characters who are meeting for the first time.  By giving these characters a history together, the relationship is strengthened, and we are starting to have a story.

3.	She raised the stakes.  By saying that she went into diabetic shock, she tells the audience that this séance is very important to the two characters, so important that they would try again even after one of them almost died.  

Moving on to the third line,

AARON JACKSON:  Yeah, you fucking lesbo.  Can we have a real séance?  My grand mother died in this house.  I killed her.  So let’s call her up!

* 	It starts with an agreement, and then raises the stakes by committing to an emotional reaction, then adds new information.
* 	Character.  We add new information with the word “lesbo.”  We’ve established that Janice is a bully and a control freak who is fixated on lesbianism.  This strengthens the character and clarifies the relationship.
* 	Story. We now know who the séance is intended to contact, and the idea of murdering someone and then trying to contact their spirit is just so stupid it’s brilliant.  
* 	Where.  We know we’re in a house where a grandmother was recently murdered.

In three lines, these two actors created a rich reality starring two characters who share a complex relationship and back story.  They did it by agreeing with each others ideas and building off of them.  The result is something wholly original.

It’s important to note the physicality that these two are utilizing, very loose, youthful energy, and using voices that indicate they are playing characters younger than the actors are. This, combined with the immature language, sets up a scene where these bitchy, cliquey high school students are trying to contact Janice’s lesbian grand-mother.

This is the golden standard when you’re starting a show.  This isn’t a good opener because it’s funny, it’s a good opener because it establishes a rich reality with characters who have a clear relationship and objective that the scene can grow from.  

This is why I love improv.  On the surface, improv looks like people being silly, having fun, fooling around.  And to a large part it is.  But there’s also a lot of learning and practice that is required before you can get to the level that this team is at, where you can have so much fun on stage while still crafting compelling scenes.

I moved to New York to take classes at UCB. But that shit's expensive.  I've been doing improv since 2006, I graduated college last year, I took 101, and I run an open mic in Bushwick.

I've been doing jams and open mics in the city, but I miss being on an honest-to-god team.  I'm looking to rehearse once a week and perform AT LEAST once a month.

My favorite teams in New York right now are Fuck That Shit and Michael Jordan Steak House.

The Tweet in question: ""Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter.""

There's a lot to unpack here:

1) It was her personal Twitter account, not an SNL affiliated-account

2) Was the joke in poor taste? IMHO yes, because the children of the President have been traditionally off-limits. However, comedy is about testing the boundaries and sometimes you cross it.
 
*(To be clear: I am anti-Barron jokes. Unlike the other Trump children, as a 10-year old he did not decide to spotlight himself in the public/political life)*

3) The only analogous situation from SNL's history really isn't (from wikipedia)--

&gt;In a December 5, 1992 ""Wayne's World"" sketch, the characters Wayne and Garth (portrayed by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey, respectively) made fun of Chelsea Clinton (daughter of the then President-elect Bill Clinton). Wayne noted that while ""adolescence has been thus far unkind"" to the then-12 year old, Garth opined that ""she could turn into a babe in waiting."" First Lady Hillary Clinton was publicly critical of the jokes and they were subsequently edited out of all repeats and syndication rebroadcasts of this sketch. ""We felt, upon reflection, that if it was in any way hurtful, it wasn't worth it,"" said executive producer Lorne Michaels. ""She's a kid, a kid who didn't choose to be in public life."" Myers even wrote an apology letter to the White House.

That bit appeared on-air on an SNL episode, which means at some point Lorne signed off on it. As far as I can tell, no one was suspended.

4) While racist/ignorant public officials have been taken to task for online comments, a public official should be held to a higher standard than a private citizen. However, we have seen examples where incendiary comments online have cost a private citizen their job. What effect will this have on other comedy writers on mainstream shows who maintain an active social media presence?

5) Some comedians are starting a [#keepkatierich hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23keepkatierich&amp;src=tyah) on Facebook and Twitter. 

I know politics is a touchy topic (and generally improvisors fall on the liberal side of things), but this is something that should be on all our radars as comedians.",SNL Writer Katie Rich Indefinitely Suspended,"Katie Rich of ‘S.N.L.’ Is Suspended for Tweet Mocking Barron Trump](  The Tweet in question: ""Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter.""

I need a tape of myself, the way stand up comics have a tape of their best jokes/set, but of my characters/performing abilities..

As an improviser If someone asked you to send them a tape, what would you send them? 

And second- how would you go about recording? In front of a live audience? At home with just a camera? 

My solo skills are: a few characters , some stand up, music/ comedic songs..

I'm just wondering if everyone who seems competent pass, or if only the cream of the crop do. 

Also, how do the letter grades play into this? Is B really passing, or do the requirements for that B really go up in 401? I heard that most people get Bs (myself included) so I'm not sure if this is a good, bad, or irrelevant thing.

It was a mini-epiphany I guess because I realized that once I took that pressure off that I made stronger, non-fear based choices and, shocker, had fun! 

And all I needed to do was relax!  Of course, the aim will be to repeat more often but, man, it was such a simple concept but made thing so much more fun/easy.

Me again, but this time with a more specific question. As I mentioned in my last post I mentioned I’ve mostly done improv with groups of atleast 3 other people. (Usually 4-8 people).

What are some more formats, games, and tips to get better at just two person improv?

1253,improv,"Hey /r/improv,

I have a request for you guys, but first a little bit of background on me:

I have been doing improv for about five years. I have done roughly 80-100 shows, founded my own Improv group in my small Atlantic Canadian City, am mostly self-learned (UCB Comedy Improv Manual, Impro, a couple Del Close books, etc.), and have mostly worked with atleast three other people.

After saving up money over the last few years I’ve made the leap to Toronto. I am planning on trying out for the second city conservatory and taking tons of workshops and classes.

I’m currently compiling a master list of online resources, articles, blogs, podcasts, and videos about learning more. I’m not looking for just comedy podcasts, but rather learning resources.

So please give me all your links and resources!

Thanks folks!

As for the setup: Putting a cruise together requires an experienced travel agent. Carnival was also not great, but not terrible. This year we are on Royal Carribean and we could not be happier.

Pairing people and getting the bookings together is probably the hardest part outside promotion. Aside from that its like booking an improv festival...but on water. Something else we did last year too.

My name is Josh, and I'm a producer for Matt Besser's podcast improv4humans. You might know Matt as one of the founders of the Upright Citizens Brigade - I4H is a fully improvised weekly podcast on the Earwolf network, featuring Matt performing with the best improvisers in the universe. This month we're launching an exciting new contest that I'd like to tell you about...

contest4improv4humans is a nationwide improv competition that will take place at participating comedy theaters across the US. Teams of 3-4 improvisers will sign up for a slot on a live show at one of these theaters; each team will be videotaped, doing their best 20 minute set in the style of improv4humans. That is, like a podcast; sitting at a table and using one-word suggestions from the audience to inspire scenes. 

Ultimately, each theater will pick a winning team and send video of their set to Earwolf. These teams will compete in a national round, and the national champions will win a trip to New York City, and a slot performing at the Del Close Marathon with Matt Besser! 

Right now contest4improv4humans is happening in theaters in sixteen cities across the country:

Atlanta - The Village Theater - www.villagecomedy.com

It's going to be the last Wednesday of every month and it's a 3 month trial period. The room costs no money upfront and the promoter takes a quarter of the door, so if it fails it won't cost me anything, no harm no fail.

There's currently very few places that do improv in Sydney so it's important to me that this room offers opportunities for newer improvisers to perform. I'm throwing around a couple of ideas for a format at the moment but this is the one I'm most drawn to;

Two halves of 40 minutes each with a 10 minute break in between. The first half would be ""open mic"" improv where 3 teams will have 10 minutes each to do improv anyway they wish (this would give newer improvisers much needed stage time and offer opportunities for more experienced improvisers to experiment a little/not get rusty). The second half would be the ""main act"" which would involve more experience improvisers performing a form I'm work shopping at the moment, that is basically an Armando/ASSSSCAT except instead of getting a suggestion from the audience we put the monologist's iphone on shuffle and the first song that pops up will be the impetus for the monologue. I think this will allow me to balance my goal of the room being a place that supports new improvisers while also offering a quality show that will have the audience feel like they're getting their money's worth.

1308,improv,"Hi, everyone!

A while back I made a post about knowing when it is time to leave an improv group. The post has been deleted, but I mentioned that I've been playing with the thought of leaving my group for reasons that vary from not having my voice heard to having a different style. I hated the way I sounded.

Well, we had the show last week and it went great! Everyone was really sharp and on their game and everyone made each other look good. On top of all that, we got a TON of laughs too. Plus, I didn't feel bad about myself or the show, and this is the first time I've felt good after a show with this group! I had a friend recorded the show, and while we had some stuff that we need to polish up, it was a very solid show. Our best one yet.

What I did differently this time around was making sure that I had enough energy (had some coffee and a sandwich beforehand), feeling good physically and mentally, and have a moment to myself before the show to collect my thoughts and focus. But most importantly, I reminded myself of the fundamentals of improv and conform to the group's energy and style. Both of those were tracks that I kept on repeat in my head throughout the entire show.

Personally, I think as we go on in our improv journey we sometimes forget the basic fundamentals and reasons why we do this art form in the first place. I went back to the drawing board and fixed what was wrong. I don't remember who all gave me the helpful feedback, but it is much appreciated and made me realize that I was in a toxic mindset going into the show and I needed to fix it asap.

Thanks again, and Merry Christmas!

  * Skip a session and do jams instead then come back with more experience and time. I'll lose my group though.

1362,improv,"So for the past year, I've taken a noticeable interest in comedy and improv. It started out with just seeing youtube clips of my favorite comedians, to listening to podcasts, to then realizing that one of the most rewarding things in my life is the ability to make other people laugh. I went to an Improv Asylum show once and I really enjoyed it. Friends of mine with comedy backgrounds (university students) have written jokes from me and they've noticed that I enjoy doing bits with them and keeping them going.

I don't really know techniques. I'm not incredibly quick-witted at all times. I might be terrible for all I know. I'm not sure what the end-goal would be. Become an actor? Unlikely. Improviser? Maybe. A more funny and confident person? I sure hope so. I'm pretty soft spoken in my day-to-day life. But I love comedy, writing, and I would love to try it out at least once. 

So I figured that since I am in college, I should try getting involved in the easiest way possible, by joining my school's team, or at least going to shows. I've also never really gotten involved in anything extracurricular, but if I had to, this would be it. 

The only problem is, I only have 2 more semesters left before I graduate. I'd be getting involved pretty late in the game. 

The biggest roadblock, however, is that my ex-boyfriend is a main cast member in my school's team. I think he joined last year. He's always at shows. My city also has a pretty small comedy/improv scene and I'm always terribly nervous I'd run into him at a show or if I ever auditioned. 

Background between me and him: he's more a pseudo ex-bf. We were friends for a whole year. We were close friends, he was into comedy. I liked him, he didn't, he punched me in the mouth with his lips a few times, and I pressed on about it too much. We fell out of touch completely. Quite awkward of me to just randomly show up at a show, right? I've moved on since then, and my current boyfriend knows about the ""situation"". He's encouraged me to go, but I'm just hesitant that:

a) it'd be painfully awkward to go to shows

b) pseudo ex bf would see this as a ploy of mine to get closer to him again. I mean, it WAS all I ever did last year (me trying to get closer to him) until our friendship deteriorated. 

c) there'd be bias against me being in the group because of him (this is a stretch, pretty early to tell if I'd even audition)

What would you do? Should I just hold onto my interests and wait longer? Move and start improv somewhere else because the chances of me running into him in this city are pretty dang high even after we graduate? Try to make amends, be casual, mend the friendship so there can be room for me too? Just go to shows not involving my university (pretty sure this guy is always at these improv shows excluding school too.. ugh)? I'd love to have some sort of creative outlet and I want to see of this could be it.

Am I being absurdly neurotic? Please help!

TL;DR: Afraid of running into ex-bf by joining my school's improv/comedy scene. ALSO, more importantly, I'd like some advice on how to get involved for the first time, never been a performer or anything!

1365,improv,"I think I've heard before that all improv games can be put into a small number of categories. Is there an article somewhere where that's lists them? How many are there?

I ask because I had an idea for improv practices:

instead of only practicing specific games, we spend a lot of time practicing a small number of very generic games each in one of the different categories. 

We currently don't play a ton of games, or at least we don't add new games to our rotation. But I feel like if we had, say, 5 different barebones games, each with different *types* and practiced them a lot, we could focus our practice more on the general idea of the game and eventually open it up to more variety and bring in more and more gimmicks. 

I say this because often time in practice we get caught up in these gimmicks or modifiers of the games and forget that we are improvisers.

We are a high school short form team. I think can be better improvisers and that's what the function of these stripped-down games would be.

I've been taking improv classes for about a year now and I've really seen myself grow in class. I want to continue to grow and perform and even move to Chicago to take classes at iO. 

As a performer, I really struggle to be confident on stage. The theatre that I regularly attend has a show where local improvisers can get on stage and perform. Whenever I'm on the backline to perform, I struggle to even think as I'm so overwhelmed with how much is going on. It's like I almost get lost in the lights. 

Do all performers go through this? It's something I wrestle with constantly whenever I want to go on stage.

Planning my 201 for some time next year, but since I'm coming in from out of town and I work and the percentage of me that's made of money is substantially less than the percentage that's made of water and carbon, the 8-week courses taught on weekdays are out of reach for me.

Need a help from anyone who improvised in a second language, or anyone who can  just give a solid advice on the topic. 

I have a nice fluency; can easily hold the multi-hour conversations on any topic with my English-speaking friends, but I construct sentences in a wrong way and use wrong words sometimes. Add to that a super obvious thick Russian accent (think Checkov from Star Track).  
It's limiting my character choice (I can't be super smart or educated), it makes me ignore heaps of possible bold choices, (I don't have time to properly translate my ideas), and sometimes it makes me beat myself up after a show, because how much potential I missed just because I was spending time on translation.

I am trying to use physicality and emotions as often as I can, but I want to expand my range. It's boring to always use same tricks for any scene, I should be able to do a scene even without any emotion or physicality...

So I would absolutely love to get any tips about performance in non-native language or hear the stories from people who share the same problem!


TL/DR:
Improviser in non-native language need tips as how to deal with this situation.

1410,improv,"I have two questions about improv classes/shows/performances.

1. I took improv 101 over the summer. I want to continue moving up in levels and take 201, but it probably still won’t be for a few months. I’m taking classes through the UCB, and I know that you can’t take the next level if it’s been longer than 2 years (I think?) since the last time you took a class, but is there a certain amount of time that you think is *too* long to take in between classes? For, say, fear of not remembering what you learned or being rusty?

2. I get really anxious before each class, and before performing. I really like improv once I’m actually doing it, but being in front of people makes me nervous, especially because I worry what they think of me, if I’m funny, etc. I’m sure a lot of people deal with this, but I’m wondering how you guys do it. I spend a lot of time convincing myself it’s going to be ok, and trying just to ignore my nervousness.

So I was thinking of doing Party Quirks in 5 groups of 5, each group with 1 host and 4 guests.  The guests would pick a slip out of a hat which I've prepared with things that someone might need (e.g. a hat because their head is cold; a dog because they want to go on walks with a friend).  Then the host would have to guess what the guest needs, and then ""give"" it to them.  

**My question is, do you think kids aged 7-10 would be successful and have fun playing this game?**  It's been a long time since I was that age, so I don't remember whether I played that game that young or whether it's a game for kids a little older.

I have to have my lesson plan in by tomorrow (Fri), so any insight ASAP would be greatly appreciated!

I direct a long-form college team of around 10 improviser at a larger West-coast state university. I'm the most experienced team member and this is my second year directing. 

Our team has historically (~15 years old) had a pretty strict attendance policy, and we've had only one team member question it. Long story short, this team member made a large fuss about a rule we've all followed based on the argument that they don't need as much practice since they do theater. 

This improviser is in their second year on the team, and I feel they are setting a bad example for the newer members. I also feel that they are not a particularly strong improviser. They have argued (fairly non-aggressively) with my notes on a few occasions, and I want our team environment to be an open forum, but I don't know how to handle someone arguing with me. Their theater experience obviously hasn't been particularly helpful to their improvising, and I've been on this team two years longer and don't feel that this argument is appropriate. 

Have any directors had similar experience? How can I foster a learning, open environment and address this person's argumentative tone?

I love impro theatre and as a complete beginner, want to offer a Workshop in my local area.

I think I have around 10 People who I can persuade to join me one evening a week for shits and giggles, and I reckon I can find a cheap venue too.

But: Apart from having lots of fun, games and a concept of gradually going from short to long form, easier to hard... what do I cover?

The UCB Manual is on my reading list, as is Improv by Keith Johnstone.

How do I take my Little knowledge and experience and build it in to a sensible arc? Am I thinking it through too much... should I just... Improvise?

Thanks for your input!

1471,improv,"I've heard a lot of people say that anyone can do improv, and that it's for everyone. I've even read a great book named, ""Improv for Everyone"" by Greg Tavares. However, the longer I perform the more I realize there are people who have taken just as many classes as I have, or performed for as long as or longer than me, but still seem to not even grasp basic concepts like listening or even agreeing. I realized before I even began typing this post that this can come across very haughty and dickish - but my point isn't that I think I'm good and other people suck - in fact I don't really have a point, I wanted to see what you guys think about the idea that everyone can do improv. It’s interesting to consider that with almost every other art form, we’re quick to point out if someone isn’t very good and that they need to go back to the basics and learn more – ie. painting, singing, writing – yet with improv we hardly ever do this. Perhaps it’s because even the most vetted, talented improviser can still bust out a shitty show once in a while, and no one wants to seem like a hypocrite. 

I tend to agree with people who think certain communities or theaters do their students a disservice when they advance anyone who is willing to pay to the next level. I know certain schools in LA, Chicago and New York don't automatically advance students just because they sign up for the next level, and I wonder what it would be like to be in a community like that. I also see the benefit of creating an encouraging community where taking chances and failing is part of the journey that makes us all better. I know I really sucked at one point, and depending on who you ask or who has seen what shows of mine, some could say I still do, so I remain objective. So maybe being graduated and given chances to perform made the most difference for me and will for others as well. This is long winded, but I'm interested to see what you guys have to say - should we encourage everybody to do improv no matter what? When/how do we communicate to people that something is just not clicking with them and that they need to retake a course or grasp a basic concept, or could it ever be that maybe improv just isn’t for some people?

However, the longer I perform the more I realize there are people who have taken just as many classes as I have, or performed for as long as or longer than me, but still seem to not even grasp basic concepts like listening or even agreeing. I realized before I even began typing this post that this can come across very haughty and dickish   but my point isn't that I think I'm good and other people suck   in fact I don't really have a point, I wanted to see what you guys think about the idea that everyone can do improv. It’s interesting to consider that with almost every other art form, we’re quick to point out if someone isn’t very good and that they need to go back to the basics and learn more – ie. painting, singing, writing – yet with improv we hardly ever do this. Perhaps it’s because even the most vetted, talented improviser can still bust out a shitty show once in a while, and no one wants to seem like a hypocrite.   I tend to agree with people who think certain communities or theaters do their students a disservice when they advance anyone who is willing to pay to the next level. I know certain schools in LA, Chicago and New York don't automatically advance students just because they sign up for the next level, and I wonder what it would be like to be in a community like that. I also see the benefit of creating an encouraging community where taking chances and failing is part of the journey that makes us all better. I know I really sucked at one point, and depending on who you ask or who has seen what shows of mine, some could say I still do, so I remain objective. So maybe being graduated and given chances to perform made the most difference for me and will for others as well. This is long winded, but I'm interested to see what you guys have to say   should we encourage everybody to do improv no matter what? When/how do we communicate to people that something is just not clicking with them and that they need to retake a course or grasp a basic concept, or could it ever be that maybe improv just isn’t for some people?

1480,improv,"Does anyone else have this issue?

I am still fairly new to improv, so I'm not sure of the ins and outs of the politics of it. I love doing improv and I love performing BUT I am so, so, so scared of doing something to destroy my career in it. Whether it's accidentally offending someone or steamrolling someone onstage without meaning to or doing something right now that I'm not even aware of. I feel like I am generally well-liked. I have plenty of friends, even close friends, and have always gotten positive feedback for my work. I've never gotten any sort of negative feedback from anyone, just constructive criticism and I've always strived to use it.

BUT.....

What if somehow I offend the ""gatekeepers"" (Meaning the owners and managers of the theaters and those who make the schedules and cast shows)? What if I post something on social media that upsets them? Or what if they're in the audience when I have a bad show? That has happened one time where a theater owner saw me perform in probably my worst show ever (And this is the only time he's ever seen me perform), so I am convinced that he thinks I'm a terrible improvisor and I'm pretty scared of that fact. I always feel awkward and nervous around the gatekeepers even though, again, they have always been nice to me. But still, if I'm talking to them, I just feel so much tension in my whole body and I'm worried that they can sense that I am very intimidated by them. I don't think anyone but total narcissists like to come off as intimidating so, again, I'm worried that they don't like me based on that. 

I'm honestly afraid of posting this because I feel like someone from the community is going to recognize my writing style and think I'm stupid. 

Anyway, does anyone else feel this way or felt this way at the beginning of their improv career? How did you get out of it?

Thank you for reading to the end if you got this far.

I’ve always loved to make people laugh. As a kid I would sneak out of my bed and write jokes in my closet (I don’t know why my closet, kids are weird and it worked). Before every Girl Scout Camp I’d make lists of jokes to drop on my fellow Brownies during the long car ride. At least 1 full page was devoted to Yo Mamma Jokes. That page was usually confiscated by a scout leader before I could finish it ;)

I hard a hard time making friends in middle school and high school. I turned shy and withdrawn (turns out I actually have social anxiety). I never stopped telling jokes, even when they were hard to get out because I was afraid of talking. I had a hard time even answering questions, so getting a joke or witty comment out wasn't easy. When I did they were usually met with hard-nosed stares. I had a bully that compounded my issues by following me around and yelling over me when I tried to speak. She said the same things nearly every time ""You're stupid"" and “You’re not funny” (Somehow as a kid those cut me to my core! That's german engineered insults for ya, simple and efficient). The responses to my attempts at comedy kind of fed my regression and my social anxiety worsened. 

Funny is subjective, of course. But I felt some glimmer of hope in my comedy when I found out my older brother regularly used my jokes on his friends to frequent success. I chalk some of it up to the environment. My family was entrenched in the Southern Baptist church, an already oppressive environment, especially towards women who were to be seen and not heard. 

Today I’m on the house team for the biggest theater in my city. After being auditioning and getting on the team we began new member training. And each week I found myself regressing. I noticed the dynamic between myself and the co-owner/co-leader of our theater echoed that of the kids back in my younger years. In one way or another he regularly communicates that I am lucky to be here, that I’m not good enough to be on the team, and that I can’t compare to everyone else with extensive improve experience (I’ve been doing improv for 1 year and a half). He's made it very clear that he believes I'm talentless and will not be putting me in shows. Recently that echo of “You’re not funny” started creeping back in my head. 

I know this is only affecting me because it’s kind of connected to my past. Normally I can shake things off pretty well, but this I can’t seem to kick. I'm stuck in a rut now, I’ve come to hate improv over the past few months. I dread going to practice. I’m bogged with self-doubt. I can’t seem to hold together a good scene. I started improv to help my social anxiety, and it did, I made major strides. But ever since I started training for the house team it’s worsened.

I’ve decided to take a break for a month, to assess things. I’m embarrassed to say I’m seriously considering quitting. In many ways, I feel like I’m broken. I can’t seem to “work” in scenes. I love comedy. I love a lot of people on the team. I used to love improv. I just feel lost.

1525,improv,"Hello,

[I posted a bit back asking about the Groundlings audition.](https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/54i8e0/tell_me_everything_i_should_know_about_the/) I got a helpful response but figured I would just make a post going more in detail in case you, like me, are someone on this sub looking for info.

I scheduled the audition online. The slots were for 2 hours, but we were only there for about 90 minutes. I brought my headshot/resume and most people did but it didn't seem like it was a big deal for the few who didn't. 

We did two warmup games. The first was sending a sound/physicality around the circle, like when you play telephone. We then did what Groundlings calls ""walk and talk"" where we walked around the room normally but then the instructor says ""you're a XYZ"" and you take on whatever walk/mannerisms/facial expressions you interpret that as. Then the instructor will ask you to stop where you are, keep your mannerisms, and 'monologue' at an imaginary character. So, for example, we did scientist and I was just super curious and talked to an imaginary barista about what they put in their drinks as if it were an experiment. In the audition setting though, no way the instructor could individually hear us so I think she was just seeing if people felt comfortable doing it.

Then we each did two scenes. The instructor provided the examples. Sometimes it was just two characters, like you are two people in a retail store. Sometimes it was two characters AND their situation, like you're a mom and son and he's about to go to college. Before you do these scenes, the instructor explained a bit of improv principles. I liked how she talked about don't do ""Yes, anyways"" where you don't deny the situation but just change the subject.

It was fun and relaxed. There were a LOT of people there who said they had agents/managers and that they were auditioning pretty much because they were told to. I passed the audition and am really excited. The few people I felt may not have were very uncomfortable with even the warm ups, like you could tell they felt stupid or something.

Everything You Should Know About the Groundlings Audition",hello  i posted a bit back asking about the groundlings audition i got a helpful response but figured i would just make a post going more in detail in case you like me are someone on this sub looking for info  i scheduled the audition online the slots were for 2 hours but we were only there for about 90 minutes i brought my headshotresume and most people did but it didnt seem like it was a big deal for the few who didnt   we did two warmup games the first was sending a soundphysicality around the circle like when you play telephone we then did what groundlings calls walk and talk where we walked around the room normally but then the instructor says youre a xyz and you take on whatever walkmannerismsfacial expressions you interpret that as then the instructor will ask you to stop where you are keep your mannerisms and monologue at an imaginary character so for example we did scientist and i was just super curious and talked to an imaginary barista about what they put in their drinks as if it were an experiment in the audition setting though no way the instructor could individually hear us so i think she was just seeing if people felt comfortable doing it  then we each did two scenes the instructor provided the examples sometimes it was just two characters like you are two people in a retail store sometimes it was two characters and their situation like youre a mom and son and hes about to go to college before you do these scenes the instructor explained a bit of improv principles i liked how she talked about dont do yes anyways where you dont deny the situation but just change the subject  it was fun and relaxed there were a lot of people there who said they had agentsmanagers and that they were auditioning pretty much because they were told to i passed the audition and am really excited the few people i felt may not have were very uncomfortable with even the warm ups like you could tell they felt stupid or something  but yeah that was the audition if you are looking for info everything you should know about the groundlings audition

1527,improv,"Been at this for less than a year with some locals with a mix of experience/training levels. We've had some bad shows, but we all knew this was coming eventually: the first time we got up there and just ate shit with a snow shovel. Everything from the macro level to the micro level went wrong, from botched longform structure to blown tagouts to physical endowments denied to juvenile, off-game misogynistic ""jokes"" to pacing and energy level.

A couple very short exchanges as we fled the scene last night confirmed the vibe is most accurately described as ""funereal"".

Cognitively, I was prepared for this. I've heard enough interviews with performers I respect to know that ""I sucked out loud last night and now I want to quit improv"" happens to everyone at some point. And so at the cognitive level, I know that this is just the nature of the beast; one shitshow by itself isn't a reason to give up, it doesn't cancel out all the good shows you've done, and if you keep at it with a positive attitude the roller coaster will -- probably, maybe -- sooner or later point in the opposite direction.

So, given that (I think) I've got a handle on the emotional end, our next group practice is tonight and I'm contemplating what *concrete, practical* behaviors people have found helpful. I see a spectrum running between the extremes of:

* acknowledge it and then move on with normal practice as though nothing happened or needs to be fixed, to:

* get out the microscope and do a full 9/11-commission report on every bad decision so we know what to work on

I can see upsides and downsides to every point in between on the spectrum. I also know that I make terrible decisions, especially under emotional duress, and radically overreact at some times and underreact at other times. I can see how at one end there's the risk of not learning from my mistakes and just repeating them, and at the other end the risk of generating a ton of salt-in-the-wound negativity in the group by turning it into a mutual complaint-fest.

TL;DR: I don't need hugs or hang in there kitty posters, but I'd love to hear people's real-world experiences with having adopted different forms of ""nothing to see here, move on"" vs. ""lets do a complete tear-down and re-build"" in the immediate aftermath.

1541,improv,"Hi all,

Compared to many of the people I improv with, I have a shallow knowledge of pop culture (specifically movie and tv references - I do okay with music references). This is a result of A) Not exposing myself to very much tv/movies and B) Not having the best recall when it comes to actor names/titles. In the past couple years I have stayed current on new releases and popular shows - but so many of the references people use are from older movies that I wasn't exposed to (this problem is especially prevalent when I am the youngest in a group (I'm in my mid 20's).

When a reference is made that I don't understand, I sometimes struggle to make the action keep flowing. I haven't performed live yet, so I'm not up on stage completely bombing bits...but I do feel like I'm missing an opportunity to play off of my ignorance instead of avoiding it. 

If any one has suggestions as to how I can play off a missed reference that would be great. Specific examples would be amazing! I listen to many of the popular improv podcasts and I know there are examples of people working with a missed reference, but none come to mind.

Additionally, if anyone has encountered this, and has taken steps to broaden their pop culture knowledge I would be interested to hear about your process.

**I have never taken any classes, so if this is an issue that is commonly addressed I apologize for bringing up redundant information!

I had a few questions on scene hogging in long form. from what I understand, it is when a player takes over the entire scene without listening and directing how the scene goes. this was sparked after reading this article:

http://jimmycarrane.com/what-to-do-if-there-is-a-stage-hog-in-your-improv-class/


1.  Billy Merrit of UCB says a good question: are you calling someone a stage hog because you are taking too long waiting in the sidelines trying to come up with idea? 

a. how do you tell if you are making a bold character choice vs scene hogging. for example, I like to create bold characters. they listen, react and rarely go into monologues etc however, I can imagine how it might appear like I am attention hogging and dominating the scene. 

2.  Jill Bernard from Huge Theater says that sometimes scene hogs are just excited to help.

a. how do you tell if you are saving a scene from going stale vs scene hogging? I noticed in longform there might be moments where some players lower the stakes of a scene or the premises are unclear, vague etc. I noticed the same fellow player would chime in to be part of the scene always to rescue it....in longform that is. I always like when the this fellow chimes in because he usually gives nice offers to keep the momentum of scene forward; however, I can see how this would seem like he is in every scene. for context lets pretend its a group of 5 players doing longform.

1543,improv,"im feeling kinda down after my improv auditions today for my college troupe. I feel like I may have screwed up in hindsight.


we did longform.

first longform scene, there was a scene with two people. Tom was about to touch a button, but Cynthia stopped him because it will explode the entire world ifyou do.

I was taught to be aware of the stakes in the scene by my teacher so I wanted to raise itby coming in and pressing it. I then saw their reactions and since there was a space where nothing happened.... I committed by pressing the button more manically. But when Cynthia said, do you feel that? I said no, while Tom said yes.  I was gonna press it again and say oh now I feel that but our jury cut the scene short and I feel like the jury thinks I am not a supportive partner. mind you I was abld to support my partners really well in all the scenes except this one.

the other audition I messed up when talking a bit. I was trying to end the scene by using a narration:
""and so our family was reunited again, once they hated eaxh other but now they became the bestest of friends. some even bullied each other....""

and also in a scene when I fumbled a few words in the sentence. I went with the mistake but I feel the fumbling of words was minus a few points for me lol.

idk. I am just anxious.

for one of these auditions (the second one)it was a callback.  idk if there is any advice on the things I did here during the audition and if there is any advive for post-auditions stress ?

update:
just found out I didnt make it for the second one via email. ",had 2 auditions today at my college troupe. nervous,"im feeling kinda down after my improv auditions today for my college troupe.

I'm in a smaller improv community in Kansas City, the main theater in town has a rapidly growing training center and many students feel lost after going through all 4 levels, if they don't make it on the main stage team when auditions come around they can feel directionless and quit.

My question is how do you encourage indie development (WRT teams and growing an indie scene) without making students feel like they're just being made to pay for one more thing (coaching fees, rehearsal space, possibly renting a theater to produce their own shows)

I get that passion needs to be part of it. If one wants more stage time one must work for it, but it's a lot more difficult to let people know what they can do in a population that doesn't have the these options ingrained in the culture.

1566,improv,"While visiting Grand Rapids I caught a shortform improv show that was mostly great. Confident players, good showmanship, well done games, and they'd clearly built up a great audience. 

But during forward/reverse two male improvisers kissed each other, and the audience laughed at it--I wish they didn't, but they did. So be it. But then the troupe made a point of then going forward and reverse over the kiss often, including slow motion on it, and I just about walked out of the theater. 

I HATE THIS. It bothers me that two male improvisers kissing often gets audiences to laugh, and two female improvisers kissing often gets audiences to make lurid woots. So be it (but I hope this will eventually change). But it really pains me to see improv troupes playing up same-gender physical affection as being comical. It strikes me as being similar to a racist minstrel show, but regarding homosexuality. 

To be clear, the complaint isn't at all against same-gender kisses on stage (I happen to be straight, and I think I've kissed as many if not more male scene partners as female scene partners in scenes).  It's treating or playing that up as inherently comical that really strikes me as offensive. 

Just thought I'd share my rant, and curious to hear what others think.

When the punchline is homophobia",while visiting grand rapids i caught a shortform improv show that was mostly great confident players good showmanship well done games and theyd clearly built up a great audience   but during forwardreverse two male improvisers kissed each other and the audience laughed at it  i wish they didnt but they did so be it but then the troupe made a point of then going forward and reverse over the kiss often including slow motion on it and i just about walked out of the theater   i hate this it bothers me that two male improvisers kissing often gets audiences to laugh and two female improvisers kissing often gets audiences to make lurid woots so be it but i hope this will eventually change but it really pains me to see improv troupes playing up same gender physical affection as being comical it strikes me as being similar to a racist minstrel show but regarding homosexuality   to be clear the complaint isnt at all against same gender kisses on stage i happen to be straight and i think ive kissed as many if not more male scene partners as female scene partners in scenes  its treating or playing that up as inherently comical that really strikes me as offensive   just thought id share my rant and curious to hear what others think     when the punchline is homophobia

1575,improv,"hi,
I recently took another improv class taught  by an experienced improviser.

today two people came up and did a scene together.
Jackie, initiated that he was pregannt.

jackie:
I dont know if I should keep it.

Ryan responded:
""no, of course not. you should keep that food baby""

our instructor said that this made him upset because Ryan changed the reality of Jackie. 

we had a discussion about it and now I want to know what reddit/improv thinks.

scene 2:

sam jumps around waves her hand in air.
chris is about to throw a baseball.

chris: okay sis, lets swing the bat now!

sam stops waving her hand, and picks upthe bat. she acts stupid like she dont know hwo to play baseball and swings, hitting chris in the nutsack.


there was a reality change in this one to, for example sam didnt have a bat but was waving her hands, bit she quickly adapted. our instructor didnt have an issue with this.



these were all very short scenes. like a 3-4 lines type of exercise.... 

MY OPINION as of now:

I think the first scene could have worked if the scene was longer. it could have been a big story about how food baby needs to go for adoption etc.

however my opinion on making offers is they should ideally affect only your own reality rather than your partner's.

Edit:

speakeasyimprov rephraed my question properly...

what are your thoughts of making choices that affect your partner's contribution to the reality that is shared?


I also found a scene online about pregnancy being a kitten:

scene 3

1596,improv,"Hi,
I have a team related question and would love any thoughts. I am a member of a 6 person group in a smaller city without a huge scene. Because of that, there aren't really any coaching options, so we've been self-running our rehearsals. (But are planning to switch to skype coaching with a coach from a bigger city). After doing this for a few months, it's become apparent that the ability levels on the team are all over the place, and that a couple of members in particular aren't at the level where they should be performing. I think a lot of this would've been avoided if we had a coach/director, but I am wondering if anyone has had experiences in having to kick members off a team? There is the option that the 4 of us could start our own thing and 'leave' the group, but that seems super shitty and passive aggressive. I imagine no matter what, feelings will be hurt, but would be good to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation and handled things in a way that wasn't a complete disaster.

1598,improv,"Hey fellow improvisers, I recently saw my coach perform with a bunch of other improvisers and my mind changed a lot about what is steamrolling versus a strong offer? What I mean by strong offer is an offer that helps establish the ""who, what where and when?"" in the scene, or adds depth to the situation.

So I saw in the show (experienced improvisers/ award winning comedians etc), which was great, that some of the improvisers when starting the scene, would talk for at least 10 seconds, where they would provide backstory, relationship etc. to their partner. I will type out the examples from the show:


Phil and Jane are sitting together. Phil wraps his arm around Jane's neck. 

P: I love that you still come over here to watch ""walking dead"" with me, every sunday, even though we are divorced already. It makes me feel like you still care deep down.

J: I'm here because I don't got cable dammit.


To me, I felt this was great initiation because it gave a lot of context to play with. It establishes a lot of things necessary for good storytelling, such as relationship, setting, etc. For me i would have enjoyed this offer by Phil, however, I can see how this is in a sense forcing an idea on another person.
scene went great.

Then there was another example. This one occured a third of the way into the scene:

gardener and single-woman.

S: Well, I guess I'm gonna have to pay you now for finishing my lawn.

G: No, No. You don't actually have to pay me.

S: What's the catch bro?

G: No catch. I'm actually a missionary from Spain. I heard that women in North America often need their lawns trimmed, so I left my country to volunteer and make sure that no woman's lawn was ever too bushy.

S: Well, you don't say. I'm gonna call  and tell all my friends about it...

scene went great, and other improvisers started asking how her lawn looked so amazing and if it was possible to hire a missionary from Spain for them etc. However, I have seen people in my class be told to keep it short.

So interested to know what the improvisers on here think about the difference between steamrolling vs strong offer.

1599,improv,"Hi everyone, in my second city level c classes, we are playing with character statuses.

I am aware that the only person I can control is myself, so any workarounds to these problems for myself would be appreciated.

So I noticed there are common safe 'go-to' choices when playing with statuses. I would like to ask help to workaround scene issues and different choices one can make when playing a specific status. I find myself not really able to have much creative contribution to the scene. Ultimately the result of these choices are that every scene more or less looks like the previous scene from the other improvisers. I have no problem carrying these safe scenes to the end, but I'd like to spice things up a bit for my own personal growth.

The same characters keep popping up, just with different occupations and played by different improvisers. overall its the same ""scared"" and ""aggressive"" dynamic.

1. 

How to play low-status if entering a scene with a ""safe high-status bully"" partner? 

I find sometimes the players I work with choose to teach, and take the socially expected superior role, and though this can be high-status without a doubt, I find what ends up happening is I run out of creative ways to heighten our statuses.

I have ways of working around it. 
An example is if my teacher is yelling at me about how stupid I am etc. Then what I will do is try to act more stupid or sabotage myelf at a task in order to make my partner look good and myself look like a pathetic little ****  I love doing that, except I am running out of creative ways to heighten the statuses for both of us.


So far I tried a few things physically:
-get on my knees and start kissing the floor they walk on
-injure myself so that the audience feels bad that I still have to carry out my high status partner's demands

any other ways to work around these scenes?

2.

Is there a way to talk more as a low-status partner, if your partner is choosing to be a ranting, yelling and verbally abusive high-status partner?

There is not much dialogue I can give myself in these cases other than agreeing with my partner's insult and insulting myself as well.

I have tried implying a backstory so the audience gets our relationship, and also imply a backstory so that my partner can take it as an offer. for example:
""I know I screwed up but, please don't bring the belt""
Luckily, my partner took it as an offer and decided that this time he was gonna bring the shark tank as punishment. 

other than that, I feel there is not much contribution I can give other than being this type of high-status's character's little puppet which though fun, can get boring :(


3.

What emotional choices are there for a low-status character reacting to a high-status character?

Aside from scared and anxious. The other ones I can think of are ""madly in love"".

EDIT: I realized sanfranimprovman took my post very personally, it seems the word ""safe"" makes me appear egotistical.... anyhow, I think the most accurate term to describe these are ""safe choices"" and that they result in a steamrolling dynamic where the high status partner pushes a lot of his ideas onto the low status. 

so I am being a responsible improviser by asking how do I react in these situations when I am being steam rolled by safe choices like teachers characters and superiors etc, so I can make things funner for myself and everyone. 

lets not get too caught up in semantics now. 

EDIT:

a workaround is simply a fix, solution and way to respond to issues in a scene such as teaching tc. no need to blow the word out of proportion to what it is.

1632,improv,"Hello, I'm Phil. I just did a one-man improvised show at the Edinburgh Fringe. I'm going to write up my show here. It's a description of what I did followed by a few things I learned from it personally. It may be of *no use to anyone whatsoever* and just be me blathering on, but if you're thinking of doing a one-prov show it might be useful. 

I posted about the show before I went away in this sub: 

[I am doing a one-prov. Is there anything I haven't considered?](https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/4pg23d/i_am_doing_a_oneprov_is_there_anything_i_havent/)    

Here's what I do in the show / how it ended up: 

------------------

#DESCRIPTION OF THE SHOW

(you can skip this if you don't want to read about my show)

------------------

* It's a 50-min show. About 5 mins of admin / warm up at the start, then 45 mins of improv. I was playing to about 20 people a night on weeknights, up to 50/60 on weekends. Not huge, but enough to have fun. Free show / pay what you want at the end. 

* Each scene was roughly 4mins, with my tech looking for an edit point (they'd play the music) at around 3min 30sec. 

* When they audience enter they don't know it's improv, including most of my friends that came to the show (I do a lot of improv, but my last two shows were written hours). [Here](http://imgur.com/a/GQT0n) is what the poster / flyer looked like.

* The show starts and I do some warm-up (crowd work, a few gags) and I tell them I'm going to do a ""Nothingist show (it's the latest craze!)"" and in order to do that you prepare nothing in advance. In fact I haven't even prepared any music. Can I borrow someone's phone? 

* That person's phone scores the rest of the show. I have a set up using OBS [seen here](http://imgur.com/a/DqZGl). I use CamTwist to ""live stream"" the presentation part of the screen, and VLC to play to back to the desktop, then projected on to a screen in the venue. The operator then alters the headings for the titles of the songs and the names of the scenes. 

* When a new song comes on between each scene I either do a gag on it or if it's appropriate to the narrative in some way, I'll weave it in 

* Then I have a series of cards on which is printed a series of prompts for the audience. I tell the audience I've prepared no material for *myself* but I have written some lines for *the audience:* they take the form of a fake argument about how much they don't like my show already: [seen here.](http://imgur.com/a/AszDJ) The fill-in-the-blanks become the scene titles. List of all the scene titles I took [here](http://imgur.com/a/uF7mY)

* The order was ""I like [scene 1, usually an object],"" ""I didn't study [scene 2, an area of study] to be treated like this,"" ""I'd rather be [scene 3, a location] than here."" And then the Video Game / TV show. 

* Then I do the usual ""this is all improvised..."" spiel. The suggestions come up on the screen, the first song plays, I do a weird dance do it as the first scene title comes up and I have two stools which I may use to put into place, and start improvising. 

* The structure is strongly based on the Harold. Three scenes, a palate-cleanser, three scenes, a palate-cleanser, something else, and then the third beat that meshes the narratives together. The palate-cleansers were a parody of an existing TV show, and me performing a new video game the audience had made up. 

* The video game consisted of me doing the intro logos (Sega / Nintendo / Playstation / XBOX) and then doing cut-scenes from the game, reaction videos on ""YouTube"", sometimes cut to the development process, or to the marketing guys, sometimes as the player trying to play the stupid game I've invented. 

* The ""something else"" (represented by the glitchy screen you can see in the OBS set-up) was an opportunity for me to explore something that hadn't been touched on in the show before, or briefly mentioned and not revisited, or else for two characters from the show to meet in a way they wouldn't normally, the characters would end this scene with a reference to how the show was free and putting money in the bucket at the end was encouraged. 

* Finally, after every show I wrote up the content of the show here: http://imgur.com/a/XZTJk (I'm British, so there's plenty of Brit references in there)

------------------

#WHAT I LEARNED

-------------------

* REPEAT SUGGESTIONS: If you've looked at the list of scenes you can see I got Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, and ""Big Butts"" a LOT. I had to learn to do something new with it each time. It wasn't always successful. When I pushed myself to go to a totally different place with it, it really flew, but if I felt stuck on the idea it was like wading through syrup. Game of Thrones scenes that I did were: John Snow trying to do stand-up, Hodor getting accidentally booked for a ""hoe-down,"" the Westeros Funeral Parlour being over-whelmed with dead bodies... These really went well. Doctor Who was more of a struggle. It was surprisingly hard to innovate around. What I ended up doing was bringing in a character from the previous scene to interact with The Doctor to move the narrative along. Big Butts became more difficult: There's only so much you can do with someone that's either obsessed with butts, or has a big butt before it starts feeling like you're doing the same scene as a previous show, just in a different location. 

* AUDIENCE MEMBERS BEING CLEVER: Due to the set-up of ""I like [blank]."" It would cause a very witty audience member to say ""I like big butts and I cannot lie"" a lot. Which is fine. But as the previous paragraph, it became difficult to innovate. The joke worked best when someone would shout ""I like cake!"" or ""I like beans!"" or ""I like you!"" It's a nice general word you can do anything with. In a ""normal"" call, you could do say ""haha, something else you like, please."" But due to this set-up I was stuck with whatever they said. If I'm doing it again, I'd like to find a way that I could avoid them saying ""big butts,"" when literally anything else (even ""penis"") I could work with, without feeling hack. 

* FEELING HACK IS INTERNAL, AND THE AUDIENCE DON'T NOTICE: On the flip-side, if a scene veers a bit near to something you did 8 shows ago, the audience isn't going to know or care. It won't be the same anyway, because you've got the whole rest of the narrative to contend with. 

* PLAY MORE CHARACTERS THAN YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH: If I was stuck in a two-character scene, I would bring a third character in. I used my standard go-to improv helpers: a mirrored character (a weird character would have an identical person, to make the straight guy look weird), an emotional character could come in to react to what was going on, a walk-by character could chip something in to help out the scene if it needed it, this also helped for stuff coming back in the second beat.

* INNOVATE ON THE SECOND BEAT: If something comes back for scene 2.x and it's not good, I'd tag myself somewhere else (usually by saying ""Cut to,"" or ""Meanwhile,"" or, ""Later..."") OR I'd bring in a new element. I was really stuck on a reality TV show scene about people discussing their exes, and it wasn't getting any laughs. And so I just threw in a parade of escaped monkeys, which in the next scene ended up fighting the Swiss Army, and pursuing a character from scene one. 

* YOU CAN START PUTTING NARRATIVES TOGETHER BEFORE THE THIRD BEAT: This is something I rarely see in Harolds, but became necessary for me doing an hour-long show, is that in the second beats, or the palate-cleansers, I'd start weaving in characters from previous scenes. That meant I could tie up some of their narratives early and forget about them for the rest of the show. 

* I LEARNED HOW TO ""PAINT"" and ""NARRATE"" IN A DIFFERENT WAY: I developed a conceit of narrating the show to do visual gags. In one scene, I blurted out (French accent:) ""I cannot come, I have to be the Eiffel Tower!"". When the scene came back, I signalled to my technician to keep the music going and I narrated a car chase through Paris as all the landmarks turned out to be giant women in disguise, slowly standing up and destroying the city. I would frantically jolt around inside the car whilst narrating the giant feet and slabs of marble crashing around me. Other times, I would describe someone falling off a cliff as if a narrator. 

* DOING SILENT SCENES: I developed with my tech a signal that I wanted them to keep playing the music, and I would do silent scenes. Bears falling in love, climbing Mt Everest, the car chase as above, weird Olympic games... 

* YOU CAN TALK IN A SILENT SCENE: But sometimes I hadn't got to my 4min mark and the scene had run out of ideas, but cutting too early would've left me with nothing to come back to. So taking the stage and the energy to speak often saved it from both running out of steam, and leaving me without something for later.

* YOU HAVE TO FIND WHEN YOUR ENERGY DROPS AND PICK IT BACK UP AGAIN: Sometimes I would notice myself getting a little laconic, or the scenes drifting and I would be getting tired. If this happened, I had to just bring in a new character, or tag my characters elsewhere, or suddenly have a reveal in the narrative to burst the energy back out again. 

* SOMETIMES YOU STRUGGLE IN THE SHIT AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT: But I kept struggling, and struggling, and trying to find the funny thing. Then when the funny thing came out (it sometimes took a minute or two) the audience would really go for it, then you could keep coming back to that game for a while and everyone felt safe. If I had abandoned the scene because it was shit, I would only have shit to come back to, and my whole show would be centred around this shit no-idea. So I kept plugging until I had a GOOD idea.

* PLAY CHARACTERS YOU AREN'T CAPABLE OF PLAYING: I'm not very good at accents. However, in the show I did Scottish, Welsh, Geordie, French, Spanish, Mexican, German, Swiss, Transylvanian, any US accent you can think of, and I'd just push myself there. And you know? After a while it wasn't half bad. I just threw myself into it and the audience either bought it, or thought my attempt was so ridiculous they loved it. I would also play women without using a silly voice (unless they were silly women, or an impression of a TV personality), just using my normal voice, but refer to the character as 'she/her.'

* BE NICE: There were times when I was tired and yesterday's show wasn't the best, it wasn't a big crowd, that I would be a bit down and a little bit grouchy. It made the scenes harder and it made me harder to like on stage. When the audience know that what you're doing is coming from a place of fun and enjoyment, they're way more likely to go with it, even if it's dark or satirical or scary. 

* DON'T BACK AWAY FROM DOWN-BEAT: In one show, the moon exploded at the end. And I described all the characters (Taylor Swift, Beethoven, an astronaut, a deep-sea diver, fishermen, Poseidon, the Queen) looking up at it, teary-eyed as their world was forever changed. A 14-year-old girl in the front row cried. Never done that before with improv. Very proud of that moment. 

* JUST SAY WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD: Even if it's really fucking weird. Even if it's really obvious. Even if it's a tired old joke. Even if it's really ""normal."" Just say it. Because the second thing won't be as clear, as good, lead you to as good a place as the first one would've done. 

* CATCH YOUR OWN MISTAKES: Notice when you say something wrong, pronounce a word incorrectly, contradict a previous character, block yourself, get someone's name wrong, forget something you did, repeat yourself. And comment on it. In one show I was miming typing and doing the clicky noises on the keyboard, which meant that character wouldn't talk and type at the same time. So I got some laughs out of that game. Then another character came in and thought the ""clickclickclickclick"" noises were the typing guy calling him a ""dick dick dick dick dick."" Scene made. 

* YOU CAN IMPROVISE FOR AN HOUR ON YOUR OWN AND IT'S STILL TREMENDOUS FUN AND EVERYONE WILL LIKE YOUR SHOW. Ibid.

Hope that's useful to someone except myself, but if not, at least it's useful to myself.

I tell the audience I've prepared no material for *myself* but I have written some lines for *the audience:* they take the form of a fake argument about how much they don't like my show already: [seen here.]( The fill in the blanks become the scene titles. List of all the scene titles I took [here](  * The order was ""I like [scene 1, usually an object],"" ""I didn't study [scene 2, an area of study] to be treated like this,"" ""I'd rather be [scene 3, a location] than here."" And then the Video Game / TV show.   * Then I do the usual ""this is all improvised..."" spiel. The suggestions come up on the screen, the first song plays, I do a weird dance do it as the first scene title comes up and I have two stools which I may use to put into place, and start improvising.   * The structure is strongly based on the Harold. Three scenes, a palate cleanser, three scenes, a palate cleanser, something else, and then the third beat that meshes the narratives together. The palate cleansers were a parody of an existing TV show, and me performing a new video game the audience had made up.   * The video game consisted of me doing the intro logos (Sega / Nintendo / Playstation / XBOX) and then doing cut scenes from the game, reaction videos on ""YouTube"", sometimes cut to the development process, or to the marketing guys, sometimes as the player trying to play the stupid game I've invented.   * The ""something else"" (represented by the glitchy screen you can see in the OBS set up) was an opportunity for me to explore something that hadn't been touched on in the show before, or briefly mentioned and not revisited, or else for two characters from the show to meet in a way they wouldn't normally, the characters would end this scene with a reference to how the show was free and putting money in the bucket at the end was encouraged.   * Finally, after every show I wrote up the content of the show here:  (I'm British, so there's plenty of Brit references in there)                      #WHAT I LEARNED                       * REPEAT SUGGESTIONS: If you've looked at the list of scenes you can see I got Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, and ""Big Butts"" a LOT. I had to learn to do something new with it each time. It wasn't always successful. When I pushed myself to go to a totally different place with it, it really flew, but if I felt stuck on the idea it was like wading through syrup. Game of Thrones scenes that I did were: John Snow trying to do stand up, Hodor getting accidentally booked for a ""hoe down,"" the Westeros Funeral Parlour being over whelmed with dead bodies... These really went well. Doctor Who was more of a struggle. It was surprisingly hard to innovate around. What I ended up doing was bringing in a character from the previous scene to interact with The Doctor to move the narrative along. Big Butts became more difficult: There's only so much you can do with someone that's either obsessed with butts, or has a big butt before it starts feeling like you're doing the same scene as a previous show, just in a different location.   * AUDIENCE MEMBERS BEING CLEVER: Due to the set up of ""I like [blank]."" It would cause a very witty audience member to say ""I like big butts and I cannot lie"" a lot. Which is fine. But as the previous paragraph, it became difficult to innovate. The joke worked best when someone would shout ""I like cake!"" or ""I like beans!"" or ""I like you!"" It's a nice general word you can do anything with. In a ""normal"" call, you could do say ""haha, something else you like, please."" But due to this set up I was stuck with whatever they said. If I'm doing it again, I'd like to find a way that I could avoid them saying ""big butts,"" when literally anything else (even ""penis"") I could work with, without feeling hack.   * FEELING HACK IS INTERNAL, AND THE AUDIENCE DON'T NOTICE: On the flip side, if a scene veers a bit near to something you did 8 shows ago, the audience isn't going to know or care. It won't be the same anyway, because you've got the whole rest of the narrative to contend with.   * PLAY MORE CHARACTERS THAN YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH: If I was stuck in a two character scene, I would bring a third character in. I used my standard go to improv helpers: a mirrored character (a weird character would have an identical person, to make the straight guy look weird), an emotional character could come in to react to what was going on, a walk by character could chip something in to help out the scene if it needed it, this also helped for stuff coming back in the second beat.  * INNOVATE ON THE SECOND BEAT: If something comes back for scene 2.x and it's not good, I'd tag myself somewhere else (usually by saying ""Cut to,"" or ""Meanwhile,"" or, ""Later..."") OR I'd bring in a new element. I was really stuck on a reality TV show scene about people discussing their exes, and it wasn't getting any laughs. And so I just threw in a parade of escaped monkeys, which in the next scene ended up fighting the Swiss Army, and pursuing a character from scene one.   * YOU CAN START PUTTING NARRATIVES TOGETHER BEFORE THE THIRD BEAT: This is something I rarely see in Harolds, but became necessary for me doing an hour long show, is that in the second beats, or the palate cleansers, I'd start weaving in characters from previous scenes. That meant I could tie up some of their narratives early and forget about them for the rest of the show.   * I LEARNED HOW TO ""PAINT"" and ""NARRATE"" IN A DIFFERENT WAY: I developed a conceit of narrating the show to do visual gags. In one scene, I blurted out (French accent:) ""I cannot come, I have to be the Eiffel Tower!"". When the scene came back, I signalled to my technician to keep the music going and I narrated a car chase through Paris as all the landmarks turned out to be giant women in disguise, slowly standing up and destroying the city. I would frantically jolt around inside the car whilst narrating the giant feet and slabs of marble crashing around me. Other times, I would describe someone falling off a cliff as if a narrator.   * DOING SILENT SCENES: I developed with my tech a signal that I wanted them to keep playing the music, and I would do silent scenes. Bears falling in love, climbing Mt Everest, the car chase as above, weird Olympic games...   * YOU CAN TALK IN A SILENT SCENE: But sometimes I hadn't got to my 4min mark and the scene had run out of ideas, but cutting too early would've left me with nothing to come back to. So taking the stage and the energy to speak often saved it from both running out of steam, and leaving me without something for later.  * YOU HAVE TO FIND WHEN YOUR ENERGY DROPS AND PICK IT BACK UP AGAIN: Sometimes I would notice myself getting a little laconic, or the scenes drifting and I would be getting tired. If this happened, I had to just bring in a new character, or tag my characters elsewhere, or suddenly have a reveal in the narrative to burst the energy back out again.   * SOMETIMES YOU STRUGGLE IN THE SHIT AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT: But I kept struggling, and struggling, and trying to find the funny thing. Then when the funny thing came out (it sometimes took a minute or two) the audience would really go for it, then you could keep coming back to that game for a while and everyone felt safe. If I had abandoned the scene because it was shit, I would only have shit to come back to, and my whole show would be centred around this shit no idea. So I kept plugging until I had a GOOD idea.  * PLAY CHARACTERS YOU AREN'T CAPABLE OF PLAYING: I'm not very good at accents. However, in the show I did Scottish, Welsh, Geordie, French, Spanish, Mexican, German, Swiss, Transylvanian, any US accent you can think of, and I'd just push myself there. And you know? After a while it wasn't half bad. I just threw myself into it and the audience either bought it, or thought my attempt was so ridiculous they loved it. I would also play women without using a silly voice (unless they were silly women, or an impression of a TV personality), just using my normal voice, but refer to the character as 'she/her.'  * BE NICE: There were times when I was tired and yesterday's show wasn't the best, it wasn't a big crowd, that I would be a bit down and a little bit grouchy. It made the scenes harder and it made me harder to like on stage. When the audience know that what you're doing is coming from a place of fun and enjoyment, they're way more likely to go with it, even if it's dark or satirical or scary.   * DON'T BACK AWAY FROM DOWN BEAT: In one show, the moon exploded at the end. And I described all the characters (Taylor Swift, Beethoven, an astronaut, a deep sea diver, fishermen, Poseidon, the Queen) looking up at it, teary eyed as their world was forever changed. A 14 year old girl in the front row cried. Never done that before with improv. Very proud of that moment.   * JUST SAY WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD: Even if it's really fucking weird. Even if it's really obvious. Even if it's a tired old joke. Even if it's really ""normal."" Just say it. Because the second thing won't be as clear, as good, lead you to as good a place as the first one would've done.   * CATCH YOUR OWN MISTAKES: Notice when you say something wrong, pronounce a word incorrectly, contradict a previous character, block yourself, get someone's name wrong, forget something you did, repeat yourself. And comment on it. In one show I was miming typing and doing the clicky noises on the keyboard, which meant that character wouldn't talk and type at the same time. So I got some laughs out of that game. Then another character came in and thought the ""clickclickclickclick"" noises were the typing guy calling him a ""dick dick dick dick dick."" Scene made.   * YOU CAN IMPROVISE FOR AN HOUR ON YOUR OWN AND IT'S STILL TREMENDOUS FUN AND EVERYONE WILL LIKE YOUR SHOW. Ibid.                                Hope that's useful to someone except myself, but if not, at least it's useful to myself.   Happy improvising.    I've just done 23 one man Harolds / one prov shows in a month. Here's what the show was and what I learned.

weekends not huge but enough to have fun free show  pay what you want at the end    each scene was roughly 4mins with my tech looking for an edit point theyd play the music at around 3min 30sec    when they audience enter they dont know its improv including most of my friends that came to the show i do a lot of improv but my last two shows were written hours here is what the poster  flyer looked like   the show starts and i do some warm up crowd work a few gags and i tell them im going to do a nothingist show its the latest craze and in order to do that you prepare nothing in advance

1647,improv,"I live in Maine.  I've been interested in improv for a while and did a bit last year when I lived in Boston and have been making little sketches up here for a bit.

1648,improv,"So I just finished the Level 2 class at the Annoyance.... on the last class the teacher and students sat in a circle and have everyone notes.... They were all so positive and happy... I was wondering what cool positive things they would say about me:

Well, I got my ass handed to me.

1658,improv,"Hi. My name is Scott and I used to be part of an improv troupe in Canada called Comedy Knights. Don't feel bad if you have never heard of us. I am also an occasional actor and more frequent writer and cartoonist. I wanted to create a webcomic that would give me something regular to publish while I go through the more laborious process of drawing my other comics, so I created one called The Insult (http://theinsultcomic.tumblr.com) which, like Dinosaur Comics, is the same pictures every time (usually) with different text.

It wasn't originally going to be improvised. Originally, I was a good little webcomicker with a ""buffer"" of a few weeks' worth of comics in the pipeline. But that dwindled away and by April or so, I found myself doing the comic the night before its publish date. And then, the morning of the publish date, which is how it has been ever since. People give me suggestions on tumblr and I have a database of ideas of my own. So now on publish days (M/W/F), I get up, pick a topic, google whatever I need to know about it, and write and publish the comic. It usually takes around 45 minutes from start to finish.

1662,improv,"Hi fellow improv players!  Over last few years I've been more interested in ""applied improv"", especially in my professional field of engineering and education.  So recently I teamed up with a colleague of mine to propose a workshop at SXSW 2017, officially called [""Improv &amp; Art Games for Designers &amp; Engineers""](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/61557).  My hope is that the designers and engineers who come to SXSW Interactive check out the workshop, so we can test out the curriculum I've made up.  The short of it is that they'd play a lot of improv games that you all know, but that are specifically chosen to prime them for doing actual engineering design techniques (brainstorming verbally and graphically).  

It's been hard to round up interest from engineers/designers who haven't done improv before, so this venue would be a neat opportunity.  Coincidentally a lot of engineers/developers seem to be in the local improv community in Austin, but that might just be because it's Austin, and/or they have the financial freedom to take improv classes and do random shows.  But I think self-selection is at play; the engineers who already are more collaborative and open to ideas might gravitate toward improv, and they don't need any convincing about the value of it.  I'm hoping that a session like mine could attract those designers/engineers who are less open to improv, as maybe they are the ones who need it the most.

Anyway, thanks for reading all this, and please vote if this sounds cool! thanks: [http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/61557](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/61557)

///vacation slideshow / ""CLICK""///
(--could ask an adult / parent to be vacationer maybe?)

///freeze tag///


Is there any way to make these games more simple / accessible? Or somehow add in emotions or animals, so the kids have something to grab onto??

I also have to be prepared that no one will want to play; no one will get it; no one will do it right. Not sure how to prepare for that ;)

Which speaks to a larger problem of how to create new long improv forms and structures. I believe very young performers make the mistake of creating complex flow charts and math-like patterns for their formats. 

I've found two good ways to go about creating a new form, and they also kinda loop around each other. The first is to focus in on and change/alter/expand/compress a single working element of a generic longform. The other is to choose a broad point you want to make—either thematically or stylistically—and begin figuring out what you would need to do in order to portray that.

1668,improv,"Hello r/improv. I've been studying improv since '09, as a young teenager. I'm currently a performer in NYC on the house team scene and the indie scene alike. 

This is the structure of Harold I'm referring to:
 25 to 40 minutes. Given three unrelated scenes A, B, and C, the structure follows:

    Opening
    Scenes A1, B1, C1
    Group Game
    Scenes A2, B2, C2
    Group Game
    Scenes A3, B3, C3 - Connections made


I think the Harold, as its currently performed, is a bad form for performance. It's certainly not the worst form and good performers can make it entertaining, but in my opinion the form itself does not live up to its reverence. Too many theaters have ""Harold Nights."" Here are my arguments:

1) The Harold is Not Fun To Watch. It can be very hard as improvisors to differentiate what's fun for us to watch and what's fun for an audience who has never seen improv before. And then, consciously, make a decision deciding whether we want to do a show for comedy nerds or a broader show for everyone. In my singular opinion, the Harold is not fun to watch unless you are an improvisor who has studied the form itself. 

From the experiences I've had with non-improv friends I've gone to see Harold night with or have come to see house team shows where I do a harold of my own, they seem to be: A) bored or confused by the opening, B) confused as to why scenes that don't work initially (a bad first beat) are returned to and C) find the scenes uncomfortably long.

This of course, is all very subjective. But I tend to agree. A great improv team will do a great Harold, but they'll most likely do a great improv set no matter what form they do. So why do we have so many intermediate performers (usually everyone's first house team experience is to DO a Harold) doing such a notoriously difficult form that makes it harder for them to perform well on a consistent basis? Especially to people who don't study at the theater.

Even on the better end of the spectrum in Harolds, I often find myself more intrigued by how well they're following the structure then genuinely enjoying the performance on stage.

I believe that as comedians and performers it is our responsibility to put on a coherent and funny show that someone can enjoy whether they've taken no improv classes or a thousand. I feel the Harold is a good form for practice in this right, but makes little sense as a performance piece, especially when we want to perform for people outside of our bubble.

2) The Harold is not fun to perform. Once again, a great team can do a great Harold. And they'd probably have fun doing it. Shannon O'Neil recently said on You Made It Weird that if you're not having fun doing the Harold, you're not doing it right. That's a valid point. But then, once again, why is it the basis of so many schools if it is so notoriously difficult.

In most curriculum (on a 4 class scale) the Harold is introduced in the second level, taught fully in the third, and then practiced intensely in the fourth. Virtually no schools teach the Harold in the first level. Because it is a difficult form that puts many people in their head.

 But starting in level 2 you are taught the Harold, usually with a significant amount of importance on the form itself. You are taught the Harold is the key to being good a long form improv, and suddenly a godlike amount of importance is put on it. So what happens when so many students struggle with it? They get put in their heads. They lose the love of improv that initially started with level 1. They begin to conceive that there's a ""right"" way of performing and a ""wrong"" way of performing (to clarify this, there's certainly always rules that help someone's improv be more consistent and interesting, but in my experience the Harold's strict structure imply that there is a CORRECT way to perform long form improv)

This is pushed even further by the multitudes of ""Harold Night"" house teams throughout the country, consisting of 8 people who are randomly placed together and forced to follow the Harold structure.

I'm going to make a blanket statement here, but most Harold nights are not great. Io, UCB might be significantly better but even these are inconsistent at best. This is because Harold Nights force people who are inorganically placed on a team together to perform a piece of long form improvisation that might not be conducive to their collective voice / skill as a team. I've seen some great Harold Nights but I've seen more where small mistakes like a skipped second beat of a B scene, or a 1st beat that got one too many walks ons caused an immense amount of tension in the room. It feels like most teams are so scared to break the structure of the Harold, but they're simultaneously bored by it. The first beats, even when the people in the scene can't find a place to go, are followed through the end. More often than not I see people who are more content performing a structurally perfect Harold with no laughs than a messy Harold with high energy and inspired scenes.

3) The Harold is not the ""Harold."" This is a pet peeve of mine and drives me nuts. After so many hours of being taught the Harold, having the form stuck into my head over and over and over again, I've yet to see a theater that actually really lets a true Harold occur. 

The original Harold was a 40 minute form, and the group games were used as short-form game pallet cleansers. The thing that really justifies the Harold as the father of Long Form it's often held up to be is the 3rd beat. 

This is where everything comes together, the connections between the scenes are made, the thematic motifs are brought to the front, and the scenes are shot rapid fire on all cylinders until a tremendous blackout. As far as I can tell from Truth in Comedy, The UCB manual, and teachers throughout the years, the Harold is a slow burn that builds to a large and satisfactory conclusion. Except...You never see it happen.

The extreme difficulty of the Harold aside, these connections are almost never made because most Harolds get blacked out after the second group game. Or maybe even the first line of a third beat. Some just die after a wipe. This is because Harolds are 30-40 minute forms and Harold nights have teams doing 20-25 minute sets. 

Currently in New York City, you cannot see a full 40 minute harold anywhere. More often than not you'll never see a Harold get to the third beat. And what's a Harold without the connections made at the end? A slow, limited montage? 


4) In Conclusion: The Harold has a rightful place in history. It even has a rightful place in practice as a master class in long form comedy. But it's the basis of too many schools. Too many uninspired shows. 

I propose that:

1) The Harold is updated to make it more conducive to a 25 minute time slot.
2) Harold nights allow teams to find the long form that works best for their collective voice and perform that instead of the Harold
3) The Harold be less emphasized as part of an introduction to several long forms, allowing students to explore many different ways of performing long form rather than just being in their heads about one.

I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on the matter. And I'd love to be convinced that the Harold, somewhere out there, is truly the pure longform joy it's been built to be. I've just been yet to see it.



",Change my view: I think the Harold is a limiting and outdated form of improv.,"Hello r/improv. I've been studying improv since '09, as a young teenager. I'm currently a performer in NYC on the house team scene and the indie scene alike.   This is the structure of Harold I'm referring to:  25 to 40 minutes. Given three unrelated scenes A, B, and C, the structure follows:      Opening     Scenes A1, B1, C1     Group Game     Scenes A2, B2, C2     Group Game     Scenes A3, B3, C3   Connections made   I think the Harold, as its currently performed, is a bad form for performance. It's certainly not the worst form and good performers can make it entertaining, but in my opinion the form itself does not live up to its reverence. Too many theaters have ""Harold Nights."" Here are my arguments:  1) The Harold is Not Fun To Watch. It can be very hard as improvisors to differentiate what's fun for us to watch and what's fun for an audience who has never seen improv before. And then, consciously, make a decision deciding whether we want to do a show for comedy nerds or a broader show for everyone. In my singular opinion, the Harold is not fun to watch unless you are an improvisor who has studied the form itself.   From the experiences I've had with non improv friends I've gone to see Harold night with or have come to see house team shows where I do a harold of my own, they seem to be: A) bored or confused by the opening, B) confused as to why scenes that don't work initially (a bad first beat) are returned to and C) find the scenes uncomfortably long.  This of course, is all very subjective. But I tend to agree. A great improv team will do a great Harold, but they'll most likely do a great improv set no matter what form they do. So why do we have so many intermediate performers (usually everyone's first house team experience is to DO a Harold) doing such a notoriously difficult form that makes it harder for them to perform well on a consistent basis? Especially to people who don't study at the theater.

So I was wondering aside from doing meetups.com and second city student shows, how does one get actual show experience?

It seems the only way people do so is through taking classes that allow you to perform onstage like in different levels of second city courses etc.

A lot of the shows or theatre requires that you had improv experience, so I assume this means you must have performed often in actual shows rather than just classes?

I live in Toronto if that is relevant.

But I feel like I've been in a rut lately. Ever since I started training with the house troupe all my scene notes seem to always be ""don'ts,"" but it's hard for me to figure them out because they seem to be contradictory. 

Below are a few examples. When I say “they” I'm referencing the 2 leaders of our troupe (who also act as instructors). In our troupe the only people that it's normal/accepted to get detailed personal critiques from are these leaders. Anyways, examples:

- They tell me to start with a strong emotion, then after the scene I'm told not to start with the emotion I chose.

- I 'm told to make bold character choices, but then I'm told not to use that character I chose and to change (this one is the hardest, a couple weeks ago one leader stopped me mid-scene and told me to stop doing a character because my character would impulsively snap her fingers and he didn't relate to it).

- We're told to have an energy balance of characters in the scene, like not to have three off the wall characters at once. But every time I play a character that isn't loud or dominant, I'm told I'm not matching my scene partner’s energy. But at the same time one leader just told me that one of my greatest strengths is how well I mirror my scene partners.

I feel like they're looking for me to make a very specific choice. And I think that cripples me because I feel like I'm not free to perform, like everything is scrutinized and I have to start a scene by figuring out what choice THEY would make rather than bringing my own personal experiences in. It's affected a lot of my confidence on stage and I struggle to actually be present in scenes now because I'm trying to filter everything and make the ""right"" choice.

I have to get them on my side because they choose show lineups and as of right now, they said they feel I'm not ready for shows.  Where I'm from this theater is the only improv option, so I can't go somewhere else, and I don't want to as I really like the people in my troupe. 

I agree with many of their critiques, I know I need to make bolder character and emotional choices. But it feels like every time I do, I choose wrong.

1686,improv,"First of all, let me start by saying, I really appreciate this community. It's already been very helpful for me. 

Now, the reason for my post. Asking a few noob questions and reading question threads started by other noobs, I've noticed a trend. 100% of the time, someone responds with ""Relax! You're still new!"", ""Don't worry, you've only been at it for ____ months"", or ""It's okay to suck at this stage of your learning.""

While I get these ""don't sweat it"" gestures, they're not helpful. IMHO, they're actually kinda frustrating. It's akin to ""You'll understand when you grow up."" Just because a person is new, doesn't mean they can't appreciate higher-level advice or that they deserve a dismissive ""Sure thing, Sport!"" type of response.

Imagine it in other scenarios: ""My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for 7 months, but no luck. Any suggestions."" ""Chill out. You'll get that baby eventually.""

""My commercial pilot lessons have been really tough since I joined last month."" ""It's a little early to get down on yourself. Just power through.""

After all, if a newbie asks a question about improv, shouldn't the responses be ""Yes and...""? 

Thanks for listening!

Edit: Thank you for your thoughtful responses. I guess my issue has a lot to do with the idea of telling someone to ""relax"" or ""don't worry"". Asking for help to advance yourself doesn't necessarily mean you're worried about your skill. For me, it's that I love this artform so much, I want to sponge up as much knowledge as possible to find what would make it even more enjoyable. Second, telling someone to relax or not to worry is pretty much the worst way to help someone relax or not worry. Show me how to relax with better technique, rather than telling me to relax.

I remember going to a few shows where there is the """"anger issues teacher"""" and ""oblivious cop"" and ""sassy mean girls"" and ""incompetent doctor"". I enjoyed watching them but wondered as a performer, Is it overdonr and isn't everything a cliche now and it depends a lot on how you present it?

**Team 1:** They have to sing all their lines. It got a bit weird when the prompt was a funeral, but still fun.

**Team 2:** They had to play the scene in mime. They had to get more physical.

**Team 3:** They were allowed to talk to the audience, but not too each other. We saw a lot of voiced thoughts, with very limited interactions.

**Team 4:** All of their physical moves must be dance figures. This was awesome. Even the most mundane interactions were very high energy and fun to watch. The actors also loved acting this.

1721,improv,"So I was in a small event a few nights ago and we went up stage to perform.

For me I find that in improv, naturally many things are politically incorrect if you really wanted to go obsessive and uptight about it. There are things thta are pure nonsense but its inevitable to not bump into a sensitive topic. even if we refuse to see it. For example, throughout the show, we had a man preparing his wedding gown to get married (could be trans phobic) and a girl with daddy issues, socially awkward people and drug dealers who put on Mexican accent. Our host was also amking white jokes about herself which ise is self depreciating himor. Not to mention there was a scene with a professor who was raging at the class. She bassically met the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder and anger management. So you could argue they are making fun of mental illness if you wanted to be uptight. And of course depressed people came up.

So when I went up on stage with my partner, I got the feeling it was an uncomfortable joke I made. So we went to an adoption clinic and I said I would like to adopt an African American baby. 

My partner looked at me and said that it was my idea and not hers. She said she was ipen to all ethnicities of babies. So she still rolled with it but I wasn't sure... the audience was laughing (they are all improvisers btw). We were holding hands like any couple would

So the receptionist offered us a baby that my partner reacted disgusted towards (it was an obese impvisor) and asked ""what is that thing?"". I reacted positively to give contrast and said that we should totally adopt her. I wasnt sure if this was out of the line but I pulled ""the baby"" towards us and said how adorable she is amd turned her to the audience. My partner said ""honey, let me handle this"". She then tuned to the receptionist and said ""dont mind him"". Dont knoe if touching the other performer was a good idea

Then we cut to the part after the adoption and we had a scene of us staring at the baby on the floor not knowing what to do. That was all.

Im probably overthinking this, because I felt if it made peiple uncomfortable someone would end the scene? Our host and her co producers would have walked across the stage to end scene or called out fast forward or tag me out if it was too much? 

I for some reason feel my partner was giving me subtle hints that I was either doing smth wrong in the scene like overdoing it or had bad timing? Why im self conscious about this is there is a huge politcal correctedness trend nowadays and though I agree that hate speech is awful, I dont know where to go in improv. As you have seen in my previous examples, improv can and in this particular show poke on sensitive topics whether ppl realixe it or not (mentally ill, social awkwardness etc).

For me a part of why I was confused was because our host who was also on the side waiting to jump in told another girl on the side across the stage to ""keep it positive"". This happened because the two ppl performing on spotlight had an affair with the gardener and his hose got caught in her hair. The girl across the other side of stage yelled ""dont you mean your hose was caught in your ass?"". She was a performer and we are allowed to as performers to yell out suggestions to change the scene up.

Idk it was confusing. This was my first lol

Any comments are appreciative.

1726,improv,"Forgive me if this isn't related, but this seems like the best place to ask it.  I just started taking classes as UCB LA, and I noticed a few open mics and shows that are described as storytelling.  I'm going to try to catch one of these shows soon, but I was hoping someone could help me clarify the concept.  Is it, as I suspect, someone just telling a story?  Wouldn't that overlap with certain types of stand-up?  For example, when I see comedians like Gabriel Inglesias perform, I notice most of his routine is him telling stories about his life, career, friends, and family.

Ray: I don't want to go to the park. Ok, instead let's go the museum.  
Bob: Let's go to the museum. The Art museum!

1730,improv,"I'm looking into getting my first tattoo, and while doing research I had this thought: what if someone got a tattoo version of a Harold?  It might go something like this:

3 artists design tattoos design tattoos based on some initial inspiration.  Then, the ideas/aesthetics/themes of those tattoos design a second round of tattoos, and then finally the themes start to come together into a final tattoo (or into some piece that connects them all).

Example: the inspiration is ""just go with it,"" and the designs for the first beat are:  
* a bending tree  
* a bottle of liquor pouring out but the stream turns into a river  
* a replication of the DVD cover from the movie 'Just Go With It'  

The second beat might be:  
* A forest of sideways trees pointing towards a sideways sun  
* an hourglass but the sand is dumping onto a beach scene  
* an ebay listing of Adam Sandler movies with no bids (this would be the best tattoo, artistically speaking)  

Then the third beat, which in this case is just one tattoo:  
* It's an hourglass turned sideways, causing the trees on the beach to bend.  Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston are bring thrown against the far wall of the hourglass.  

My example is obviously bad on purpose, but I actually think a harold in tattoos would be super cool, and if you picked a theme with meaning to you it would have double depth (provided you are passionate about improv, and since you're here I assume you are.)

1732,improv,"Back in February I performed in my 1,000th show as improviser / stand-up comedian. I tracked all of the shows in an excel sheet and decided to analyze them and thought others might be interested in seeing it.

Full analysis here: http://drewtarvin.com/comedy/in-depth-analysis-1000-performances/

General Highlights:

* I started doing comedy in October 2004.
* I performed 1,000 shows in 4,130 days or roughly 1 show every 4 days.
* I performed 7 types of shows, primarily shortform improv and stand-up, but also longform, musical, spoken word, storytelling, and sketch.
* I performed for 681 hours or roughly 28 days.
* I performed in front of an estimated 41,240 people.
* I performed in 104 cities, in 45 states, in 3 countries, and on 2 continents.
* I performed at least once every month from December 2007 to February 2016 (a streak of 99 months).

Improv Specific Stats:

* I did 673 improv shows. 436 were shortform, 172 were longform, and 66 were musical.
* Total performance time was just over 648 hours. The average duration of shortform was 75 minutes, longform was 23 minutes, and musical was 22 minutes.
* I’ve done improv in front more than 28,000 people. My biggest audience was 1,200, my smallest was 4.
* I’ve done improv in 20 states.
* The most improv shows I’ve done in a year is 118. The most in a month is 19. The most in a day is 4.

Edit to add some of what I've learned as a result of the analysis:

1. **On where to live.** Do you want to do as many shows as possible? Move to NYC, LA, or Chicago. Do you want to do less shows but for bigger audiences? Stick to a middle size city (aka small fish in a big pond).
2. **On performance type.** I strongly encourage all performers to try different types of performance, and not just different types of improv (shortform, longform, musical), though definitely do that. But doing stand-up for 5 minutes versus storytelling for 7 minutes versus 25 minutes for longform are all very different experiences and can all help make you a more rounded performer.
3. **Think about what you want.** I know some improvisers who look down on shortform or people from one improv school look down on people from others, which to me makes no sense. Think about what you want and then find what types of groups will help you get there. I tried a bunch of different things and then stuck to the ones I enjoyed the most.
4. **Invest in a group with people you like.** I've been on teams where I'm friendly with the other players and I've been on teams where I've been friends with the other players. The latter is definitely better and I did a lot more shows with those types of group.
5. **Find what motivates you.** I'm motivated by numbers, by specific goals that I can measure and track. It's what got me out to an improv jam when I didn't feel like leaving my couch. Figure out what will motivate you to get better.

I’m curious if anyone else has similar data or how this compares to other people on this subreddit.

Anyway, we don't have the luxury of a live band, so I was wondering if any of you here could point me to any good pre-recorded background tracks (Preferably musical theater style, piano heavy/dramatic and such) that we might be able to use, if such a thing exists.

I'm taking Improv 101 at the UCB and hopefully will be able to take more classes, but in the meanwhile, I'd like to get together with people that are interested in improv/sketch and create stuff with them.

My worry is that I don't have a ton of experience, but I'm hoping that just by working on stuff and writing and collaborating with people, I'll eventually get better. I also just really want to make stuff, but I need other people to do that, as I can't do it all on my own.

My plan has been to enroll at Second City and go through the conservatory program, but I've recently been hearing that other programs like the IO or the Annoyance theater are better for newer students.

A little background:
I'm 18 years old and have graduated high school through the running start program with my AA. I've taken 6 years of improv through my local youth theater, and at our competition I've won the MVP award twice out of 30 students.

My main goal for studying improv is to somehow make a living entertaining. That could look like improv on the weekends with a second job, to stand up, all the way up to TV/movies. 

My current plan is to enroll at Second City conservatory and see what happens from there. I've emailed the class coordinator to see where I would have to start and he said I'd should start at the ""Improv for Actors"" class, which would make me eligible for auditioning for the conservatory January 2017. 

I am interested in the style of sketch comedy that Second City does, but my first love is improv.

Is Second City the right place to start? Any advice from those who have been down this road would be really appreciated!

There is a new podcast in town (or rather… on the Internet) and it’s called CONVERSATIONS WITH FUNNY FEMINISTS, created and hosted by funny woman Pam Victor, co-author of “Improvisation at the Speed of Life: The TJ &amp; Dave Book.”

In this monthly podcast, Pam Victor geeks out with well-known funny feminists about the state of women in comedy with a focus on providing practical tips for comedians. Created in reaction to the recent sexual harassment scandals that have surfaced in major improv and scripted theaters in Chicago and LA, CONVERSATION WITH FUNNY FEMINISTS keeps the discussion going in an effort to provide opportunities for healing, growth, and the evolution of the treatment of women in comedy. This podcasts talks to big-name improv and scripted comedians to help women in comedy figure out how to best navigate the comedy world as well as how to face unfortunate issues as they arise: What do you do when a teacher you respect is treating you like his precious pet prodigy? What do you do when a superstar in the improv world texts you an inappropriate photo? What do you do when you’re at a party and the guy who casts shows at your theater comes onto you? What do you do when immature fellow performers trap you in a scene you’re uncomfortable with? These situations are all too common in the comedy world. CONVERSATION WITH FUNNY FEMINISTS adds air and intelligence to these issues with an aim to provide useful tools that comedians can employ at their next rehearsal, class, or show. Oh, and there is a lot of laughter too!

The first episode is being released and features improv guru Susan Messing (iO, Annoyance and Second City Theaters.) Upcoming funny feminist guests include Stephnie Weir (MadTV and Lady Dynamite); Rachael Mason (Head of Advanced Improvisation at Second City/Chicago); Jill Bernard (Huge Theater and ComedySportz in Minneapolis); and Megan Gray (Artistic Director of Magnet Theater, NYC). And many, many more!

Pam Victor is the co-author of “Improvisation at the Speed of Life: The TJ &amp; Dave Book” along with legendary improvisers TJ Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi. She writes the popular blog interview series “The Zen of Improv” and “Geeking Out with…” and gets into toasty tête-à-têtes with headliners at improv comedy festivals in “Geeking Out with: The Live Talk Show.” A nationally-touring improv teacher, Pam Victor is the founder and president of Happier Valley Comedy (Western Massachusetts) where she designed and runs a full, multi-level improv school, produces improv shows, and facilitates corporate development workshops.

1777,improv,"I have been doing improv for the last 6 months or so. Initially twice a week, now its once a week, and am going to start doing it twice a week again.

The reason for me getting started in improv, is not because I want to become an improv star, but to improve my communication skills. Though if I become mini-star that would be great too..

During my last long form improv class, level C, I started hitting some walls. I found I am not as good a listener as I thought, also I had a hard time creating new scenes. 

It maybe due to a lot of reasons. Partially because my mother tongue is not english (though I am fluent in english), because of almost non-existent life experiences to draw scenes from (I was very very introverted, hide-in-my-room-all-day introvert for over 28 years), because I am also a poor listener, and have some anxiety issues. I am not shy atleast not now.

What I saw was that I would create scenes which were based on conflict a lot, and even though our instructor told us not to go there I would repeatedly go there. As a result I wouldnt be able to sustain a scene for a long period of time. i would usually get a huge laughter due to something random I would create, but others would be better at adding details to the scene, storytelling etc. 

I am thinking that even though I struggeled, this is actually a good opportunity for growth. So I am going to keep doing improv, and invest more into it. 

The last level (Level D) that I am going into in our school is a short form improv, and after that we will have another performance.

I run a D&amp;D campaign, and have been for the past year. I got into the hobby by watching Critical Role, a twitch stream of several professional voice actors playing the game. Their incredibly talented DM has suggested a few times improv classes.


What can I do, read, write, etc which would improve my improv skills. I don't especially have the time for improv classes, but I was wondering if their was a video series or book or something to help me.


Specifically, I want to improve my skills at:

- Descriptions on the fly
- Storytelling on the fly
- Accents?


So far, it seems like paying an incredible amount of attention would help me a lot, with the goal of keeping images of what's happening in my head, so all I have to do is describe that, but I'm sure there is more to it than that.


Thank you all.

French speaking improv guy here. I need your help.
I've been doing improv since I was 12 (here, it's literally a national sport), in all kinds of ways. I played in 30 cities or so in Europe and North-America, mostly in french. Did a couple of shows in english. Gave hundreds of hours of coaching. Started my company.

I'm a performer from New York who recently moved to Chicago. I'd love to start taking classes again, but I'm not quite sure where to start. I had a few indie teams that performed regularly, and I did the full improv program and a few Advanced Study classes at UCB. I'm not completely green, just probably out of practice because I took a break last year. 

Most of the related advice on this sub seems to be for people starting improv in Chicago from very little experience... Are the local theatres' teaching styles different enough that I should jump in from Level 1 and familiarize myself? (I know iO doesn't take other programs' credits into consideration so I'd have to start at Level 1) Or should I focus on indie stuff and auditioning for Second City conservatory?

I'm a performer from New York who recently moved to Chicago. I'd love to start taking classes again, but I'm not quite sure where to start. I had a few indie teams that performed regularly, and I did the full improv program and a few Advanced Study classes at UCB. I'm not completely green, just probably out of practice because I took a break last year.   Most of the related advice on this sub seems to be for people starting improv in Chicago from very little experience... Are the local theatres' teaching styles different enough that I should jump in from Level 1 and familiarize myself? (I know iO doesn't take other programs' credits into consideration so I'd have to start at Level 1) Or should I focus on indie stuff and auditioning for Second City conservatory?

It was amazing because they had to listen to the other and incorporate it into their own story almost instantly, so it was perfectly consistent.

Acceptance was mostly all about getting in a yes-anding attitude towards the partner and the scene; and about identifying open/closed and verbal/physical offers. The ""Being Present"" section dealt with exercises to be aware of how important listening and visual attention are in improv.

- Favorite exercise: Gifts. In a circle, passing a mimicked gift in open offer, and then another couple of rounds as a closed offer.

- Main note: I congratulated them about leaving their inner censor.

SpeakeasyImprov asked me a couple of questions in the day one post, and I thought about answering them for this one too:
• What did you learn? - That, as people, agreeing is something we like to do.
• What challenges did you experience? - Distractions!
• Was anything easier than you expected? Harder? - Easier, their willingness to play. Harder, from time to time, keeping them in the present (they got distracted quite easily in this one).
• If you had to change anything, what would it be? Being more specific in my exercise instructions. I had a couple that were kind of loose, and I corrected that afterwards.

1867,improv,"Hey!

I've just started teaching 101, and I'm having trouble coming up with exercises about dealing with mistakes within improv. So far, my philosophy is to give notes and point out positive and negative attitudes towards error.

My next class will focus on acceptance and being present, so I think that subject is really important. Do you have any ideas?

I just finished my first few introductory lessons at theatre sports, and I know the road ahead is very long, but I have a couple questions regarding studying improv long-term.

Does ""fake it till you make it"" work in this industry?

Do introverts/awkward people start at a disadvantage compared to quirky, outspoken people?

As a beginner on stage I experienced a lot of the feeling of isolation and being part of a story that had no clear direction or ""space"" to move around in it. Is this a beginner thing?

1889,improv,"Hey /r/improv, I'm running my first ever ""intro to improv"" workshop in a few weeks. I've been performing and playing for a few years, and done more than my share of facilitating, coaching, and teaching-- I live in a small city where four years is a lot of experience! However, I have never run a course for people with NO training before, indeed it's unlikely any have any background in sketch, stand-up, or theatre.

The goal of the workshop is really to get people having fun and understand the philosophy, moreso than the practice, of improv. With that in mind I'm doing exercises to introduce people to:

* Yessing
* Yes, anding (borrowing from Jason Shotts the idea of learning to say yes, before and)
* Playing themselves in scenes; the idea that ""characters,"" are just you with a layer, and ""scenes,"" are often just conversations with more truth, meaning, and importance.
* Putting this stuff in to a context of playfulness.

1890,improv,"I'm a Level 4 student who's been studying improv for a year now. I've always struggle with initiations, something I made both my Level 2 and 3 teacher aware of. But it finally took my Level 4 teacher spelling it out to me how to do it.

What my teacher said to do is find a word from the opener. Then A-to-B it (what does that word make you think of?) Now with that new word how does that word relate to your life? Do you have a story with that new word? An emotional response? 

A few of the examples we came up with in class tonight were:

I picked out the word economy. From that I thought of the word poor. Poor makes me think of how I've never had to deal with money issues and can just ask my dad for money. So my teacher and I did a practice scene about me taking advantage of my father. 

There was the word brick. My teacher noted that's a Ben Fold's song. I told him Ben Fold's once wrote a song about a squirrel killing himself. So my teacher said, ""Dad! You know that squirrel in the backyard. He's got a rope tied around his neck.""

Later I heard the word frostbite. Which made me think of amputation. And that made me think how I'm a hypochondriac who always thinks the worst when I get hurt, like I'm going to lose my arm. So I wind up doing a scene where I endow my scene partner with a papercut and tell him he's overreacting. 

This type of brain storm probably works best for word specific openers, such as the pattern game or invocation (we were actually doing them when I pointed out to my teacher I couldn't pull anything from it). I just thought I'd share since this is the first time pulling ideas from openers has ever seemed clear to me and some other students might be struggling with the same issue.

Long time listener, first time poster.

I'm an improviser from Sydney, Australia, and I'm going to be coming to Chicago and New York this July/August. I'll be taking the iO Chicago Summer Intensive for 5 weeks in July/beginning of August, and then I'll be in New York from the 12th till the 21st, after which I fly back.

While I'm pretty much set for what to do in Chicago (and 5 weeks is plenty of time to explore, find places to jam and play, etc), since I'm only spending 9 days in New York, I'd love to know of any jams or workshops or week-long intensives or drop-in classes that I could conceivably do while I'm there.

I know UCB have their 101 intensive starting on the 15th which is one option, although I'm a bit concerned that 101 might be a bit too foundational (and I've heard it tends to very much be actors/people looking for a resume boost). I can theoretically do 201 (spoke to UCB about it since I would have completed the iO intensive by then) but thats a two week intensive and I have to leave on the 21st and return to reality.

What other options are there? I know Magnet offers week-long intensives, are they any good (especially compared to UCB)? Also know that PIT offers drop-in classes, which I’ll look into as well. Are there other theatres I should be looking at? Or maybe open jams with existing troupes?
I'd love some advice on how best I should use my time there, don't want to waste a second!

Thanks heaps!",Coming to New York from Sydney for 9 days in August. What are some workshops/intensives/open jams/drop-in classes I could conceivably do in a week?,"Hi guys!

I have High Functioning Autism/Asperger's Syndrome. While I don't have much luck with dating, I did meet some interesting people by being involved in some group hobbies, namely board games and improvised theatre.

The great part of getting the activity groups is that you can interact with people in a well defined setting. I will talk more about improv.

Or meetings consist of our teacher giving us some hints, then doing some warm up games, and then playing some scenes. It is liberating to know that

1. This is a small and friendly group, if I do something wrong, our teacher will give me immediate feedback to correct it.
1. While acting, I don't have to do any social interactions, just play the game
2. While playing, you can't mess up. If you say something stupid or inappropriate, it's funny, people laugh.
1. I have things to talk about as we have something in common.

This controlled environment helped me to expand my comfort zone and actually started making friends. Eventually, I started leading the group for a few months and produced my very own show for stage. It happened step by step.

I would say my importing group is probably why I'm not coming up with elaborate and failsafe plans for killing myself while leaving instructions to my family to access my bank accounts and belongings etc.

I've just now published my first post on it called Purpose. Which details why I'm writing the blog, and why you might be interested in reading it. If your interested take a gander and leave me some feedback. I want to get better.

I did once off camera where we came up with the lines and such, then we did the camera run-through. I know it's not perfectly-improv, but I thought this was a place to start.

I'm fine with some critical honesty, and I know myself that a lot are rough. Just something fun to do. I appreciate any feedback.

I ask because the very first theater I took improv classes at warned people that they have to be invited into the following level and that it was hard to get through all four of their levels without being asked to repeat one.  I was totally fine with this, but it felt like everyone just got invited back, even if they didn't seem ready.

1958,improv,"Hey!  I'm a grade 12 guy who has been doing official improv since September.

#team info
I was put on the High school B-Team this year, and I am hoping to make the A-Team next year.  There is going to be one open spot next year due to graduation.  The competition for that spot is going to be very close, there are probably about 5 contenders in the B-Team that could get in, myself included.  Most people on the A-Team are gr11-12, whereas the B-Team is primarily gr9-10.  I like everyone on the B-Team, but I relate more to the A-Team.

The A-Team is a top contender at regional competitions, placing 2nd 3 years in a row.  The B-Team is less competitive, placing around 20th out of 30ish this past year.  The B-Team is funny and entertaining, but doesn't have the substance to compete competitively.

#personal info
Now, onto me.  I'm a competitive, but fun guy.  I play more of a reactionary style.  I am good at listening and coming up with funny and logical wit to add to the scene.  I want to work on my quick thinking to train my brain to be faster at coming up with ideas on the spot.  (Ex. coming up with characters and motives quickly).  I also want to get good at focusing on underlying themes and making connections.  (Ex. the theme is gold, I want to relate to that theme as much as I can while playing).

I'm looking for daily or weekly exercises to do by myself to hone my abilities before September.  These can just be things to do mentally, in front of a mirror, reading or listening online, I'm open to anything.  I want to stand out in September as a strong improviser.

Do you think having fun on-stage, connecting with your scene partners, and reacting honestly ever DOESN'T lead to playing in or watching an enjoyable improv set? 

I want to know what makes the difference between a team you enjoy watching anytime versus a team that's impressive in some moments, but not necessary for you to see ever again...a team you're just not that interested in watching. Sure, you admire their moves and scene-work, but do you actually care? I usually don't. People having fun and connecting is just so damn FUN to watch. 

Everyone plays differently, and I know that learning the structure of the game and having a deal and POV can be very helpful. And yet I'm still in my head about them. Fun seems like a simpler goal to pursue than ""good scene-work""  and I just wonder if somehow the ability to tap into that can short-circuit years of training and classes where getting in your head prevents you from actually ENJOYING your improv.

1994,improv,"Hi! Was sent here from /r/comedywriting. 

I was recently given a 2 hour radio show (3-5AM, ugh) and I'd love to get some weirdo, Tim and Eric style calls; possibly with recurring characters, during mic breaks after blocks of music. 

I can pre-record the calls, and can improv (poorly), and was hoping you might be able to provide some resources? Or perhaps help out? The show is on community radio, so I can't really offer much in compensation (shitty, I know. Sorry). Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated!

To kind of set the tone of the direction– my friend and I were thinking about having one character that calls in every show asking for directions to the Hard Rock Cafe in a different town each episode. Just ridiculous stuff in the vein of [Longmont Potion Castle](https://youtu.be/Mb3pVTdOd7I) or characters like [Bob Ducca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMIBQuLlXI) from Comedy Bang Bang. 

 Thanks!!

I’ve been doing stand up for about a year and a half now and it’s been going well. I really feel myself getting better at finding my voice and I’m starting to travel outside my comfort zone for more gigs to see if my jokes travel beyond where I’m always gigging. 

Recently, I’ve been having trouble though as my dad recently passed away which has resulted in a lot of things in my life changing at a pace I can’t control. All my friends in stand up suggested I take a break and I took a month off, and have now recently started to come back and get my stride back. I really want to keep gigging because stand up is my passion and I always feel great being able to turn things that have happened to me into funny jokes that an audience enjoys, but I feel like eventually I’m going to have to bring up my Dad on stage (as in jokes, I’m not bringing up his ashes) 

Dead relative jokes I imagine would be a really tough sell in comedy clubs, especially if you’re not someone who’s used to doing dark humour. My style’s more cheeky and likable funny according to booker feedback and I keep worrying that suddenly bringing up a dead relative in my set would go against my stage persona, but I know I’ll have to do jokes about him if I want to keep being authentic and relatable on stage. 

Is this something any of you guys have had to do before and even if not, any advice you could give would be massively helpful.",My dad recently died and I feel like I have to joke about it,"I’ve been doing stand up for about a year and a half now and it’s been going well.

- I’ve been 26 for a few hours now and so far it fucking sucks….. Not because of ‘fuck I am almost thirty’ crisis. But because my parent’s health insurance no longer wants me, and neither does Leonardo DiCaprio


As I get closer to thirty I realize we actually have two puberties. The physical puberty in our teens, and then the emotional puberty in our 20’s. You’re perpetually depressed and horny in both, except one makes your face look like peperoni pizza, and the later makes your joints crack during sex
 

The word clonic in my stage name is a former term for a grand mal seizure. I’m an epileptic, which just means I’ve mastered the art of the hokey pokey
 

Fucking an epileptic is great. I once had a seizure riding my ex, and my pussy was squeezing his cock harder than a cop chokes his wife


 *Who here is queer*
Great this place just became a gay bar  
                    	Or
       Impossible; no one is 100% straight
 
 

I blame high school band for making me queer. It was there I learned to finger and blow
 


If you couldn’t tell I am Jew…ish. As in the only prerequisite to be Jew..ish is to be a comedian


As a queer Jew, hiding in the closet is part of my cultural identity.


I am originally from New Jersey….. New Jersey doesn’t trust you with pumping your own gas, but trusts you enough to pump your own cousin. And you thought Alabama was weird.


As a teenager with nothing better to do in New Jersey my friends and I went dumpster diving. Moving to New York I learned that dumpster diving just means Apartment hunting.


I am studying to be a math teacher. And the only benefit of marrying a teacher is having health insurance.

*Anyone here in therapy?*
 My therapist is great, but I only do comedy because therapy isn’t enough.


*Who here take antidepressants?*
Being on anti-depressants and in a sexual relationship, you never know if the anti-depressant is making it difficult to cum, or if they just suck in bed",My show script so far,"How is everyone tonight?

It was there I learned to finger and blow     If you couldn’t tell I am Jew…ish. As in the only prerequisite to be Jew..ish is to be a comedian   As a queer Jew, hiding in the closet is part of my cultural identity.   I am originally from New Jersey….. New Jersey doesn’t trust you with pumping your own gas, but trusts you enough to pump your own cousin. And you thought Alabama was weird.   As a teenager with nothing better to do in New Jersey my friends and I went dumpster diving. Moving to New York I learned that dumpster diving just means Apartment hunting.   I am studying to be a math teacher. And the only benefit of marrying a teacher is having health insurance.  *Anyone here in therapy?*  My therapist is great, but I only do comedy because therapy isn’t enough.   *Who here take antidepressants?* Being on anti depressants and in a sexual relationship, you never know if the anti depressant is making it difficult to cum, or if they just suck in bed My show script so far",how is everyone tonight     ive been 26 for a few hours now and so far it fucking sucks not because of fuck i am almost thirty crisis but because my parents health insurance no longer wants me and neither does leonardo dicaprio   as i get closer to thirty i realize we actually have two puberties the physical puberty in our teens and then the emotional puberty in our 20s youre perpetually depressed and horny in both except one makes your face look like peperoni pizza and the later makes your joints crack during sex    the word clonic in my stage name is a former term for a grand mal seizure im an epileptic which just means ive mastered the art of the hokey pokey    fucking an epileptic is great i once had a seizure riding my ex and my pussy was squeezing his cock harder than a cop chokes his wife    who here is queer great this place just became a gay bar                       	or        impossible no one is 100 straight      i blame high school band for making me queer it was there i learned to finger and blow     if you couldnt tell i am jewish as in the only prerequisite to be jewish is to be a comedian   as a queer jew hiding in the closet is part of my cultural identity   i am originally from new jersey new jersey doesnt trust you with pumping your own gas but trusts you enough to pump your own cousin and you thought alabama was weird   as a teenager with nothing better to do in new jersey my friends and i went dumpster diving moving to new york i learned that dumpster diving just means apartment hunting   i am studying to be a math teacher and the only benefit of marrying a teacher is having health insurance  anyone here in therapy  my therapist is great but i only do comedy because therapy isnt enough   who here take antidepressants being on anti depressants and in a sexual relationship you never know if the anti depressant is making it difficult to cum or if they just suck in bed my show script so far

Hey there, I wanted to share something with you that's really important to me. I recently started a YouTube channel called HubNonsense, and it's all about showcasing the funniest and goofiest stand-up comedy clips from a variety of comedians.

Starting a new channel is always a bit nerve-wracking, and it's hard to get noticed in the sea of content out there. That's why I'm reaching out to you today - I could really use your help in spreading the word about my channel.

I truly believe that HubNonsense has something special to offer. It's all about bringing joy and laughter into people's lives, which I think is something we could all use a little more of right now.

The channel features short clips of the best jokes from a variety of stand-up comedians, so there's something for everyone. And the best part is that I upload new content every single day, so there's always something fresh and funny to check out.

The community around the channel is already growing into a supportive and fun-loving group of people, and I would be honored to have you be a part of it.

So if you have a few minutes to spare, I'd be so grateful if you could check out HubNonsense and share it with your friends and family. Every new subscriber and view helps me to keep creating more content and bringing more joy into the world.

Thank you so much for your support, and I hope you enjoy the channel!

2463,StandUpComedy,"okay, this happened about two years ago (woah) - but I'm posting about it now because I'm about to do a ""Science Standup"" routine. Basically, it's regular stand-up but it has to be about something science-based, and **I'm looking for opinions on how to make this story into that.** 

So about two years ago, I (now 29f), was on my way to pick up some friends and head to FL. It was a cold morning and I noticed my tires needed some air, so I decided to stop at a gas station to fill them up. I pulled up next to the air pump machine and kept my car turned on with my phone inside while I filled up (it was 8 am on a Thursday in Virginia Highlands -  who tf is out stealing cars?). Right before I got out of the car, I swear to God, I remembered this NPR story I had heard a few weeks before about how Uber eats drivers were getting their cars stolen because they just leave them running while they go in to grab the food. Why that thought didn't prompt me from saving myself? Who knows. 

As I'm filling up my tires I look over to my right and I notice this angry girl coming out of Buddies. She's about my height, a white girl, with brown hair, with a black puffer jacket on - just like me. In my head I'm like what's this girl's problem? But I figure she's just pissed off because she left her wallet at home or some shit. I continue pumping air into my tires and notice my tires start ROLLING AWAY. I look up and there this girl is in the drivers seat, just casually backing my car away like it was her car!!! She's like putting her arm over the passenger seat, backing out, looks right past me like I didn't exist. Just a casual morning drive for her. 

I instinctively scream at the top of my lungs and hit the windshield super hard with the palm of my hand (cracked my window) and she just drives away with the vehicle. 

So I'm freaking out, someone calls the cops on their phones yada yada. I sprint home in socks and sandals (about a 10 minute run at this point) and grab my MacBook to text my friends the reason why I'm not there to pick them up yet. My boyfriends talking to the cops at my house while I'm on his work phone talking to my friends about the situation. 

My friends remember they have my phone location so they tell me they're going to follow the tracker. They're driving around, asking me about my car, what color it is, what type, etc., and as I'm describing it they're like ""wait.. does it have a side swipe?"" (it does). They're like ""holy shit we found your fucking car!!!"". We tell the cop, who tells us to hop into their car to go check out the crime scene (I should mention it's fucking April fool's day). 

We get to my car (across the street from the exact location I was originally heading to), it's still on, and nothing was taken (I had like three bags in there since I was going on vacation). The bags weren't even TOUCHED. My phone was still missing but we ended up finding that in the park nearby. What's weird is that it seems she turned my phone off, turned it back on, then threw it out the window into the park. I know this because when I turn my phone back on my contacts are missing for a little bit until I start to use it for a little while. 

All this happened within an hour of the car getting stolen, and the girl was never found. I have a few theories since the girl looked eerily similar to me and it was so fucking weird. Either I time-traveled to try to stop myself from going to Florida, or I went mentally insane and stole my own car. 

**How tf do I turn this into 'science stand-up'?**

2651,StandUpComedy,"I've been a reporter for The Pulse, a science show made by WHYY that airs on NPR stations for five years. I helped edit SERUM, an excellent limited-run investigative podcast.

I also do stand up mostly local to Philly and New York. I post reels on my IG @ JadSlay, (about an hour's worth at this point) A lot of clips here too.

My boss /team all knew and didn't care. My stage name is just my first name, last initial, Jad S (Arabic last name, tough for hosts). I never talk about work.

But recently I got called into a meeting with no warning and fired on the spot for ""egregious violations of WHYY values"" because of those reels. Guess some exec(s)/director(s) of whatever saw them? I dunno.

My act isn't clean, deals with dark stuff, I'm a former Marine, an Arab Muslim from West Virginia and I used to be a war correspondent and EMT.

But in all my clips it's a room full of people laughing. (They’re all clips where I’m doing well obviously)

I told them I’m a complete unknown, no real fan base. If you’re at my level and try to do true edge lord stuff, you just bomb. I told them I get booked at black shows, gay clubs, up in the Poconos for old white people, everybody has fun.

 Isn’t the laughter proof you're overreacting?

They didn't care, it's like they mentally edited out the audience. If I'm so shitty for telling these jokes, what's that make the laughing crowd?

My work knows I recently got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (had some trouble walking, stable atm tho) and losing my job means it's back to the VA hospital that's not really designed for that. 

They flat didn't give a shit. It was kind of unreal just how enraged they were (again, not my team or my actual boss). 

I dont think your employer should have a say in your off hours creative expression(unless you like shit talk them), but at the same time I wouldve changed my byline or stage name, whatever. Didn't get a chance. They said the meeting was over.

This all seems like a kind of moral extremism to me. You watch clips of a show that a diverse room full of people is enjoying and your reaction to that is... blind fury? 

You go yeah for his jokes this guy needs to lose his livelihood and his doctors.  I feel like these people would take me out back and shoot me if they could get away with it.

The VA has improved over the years so fingers crossed on that.

But I told them I wouldn't let them do this quietly. Ive been a journalist for 13 years and if I ever want to work in media again they'll ask why I was fired and it's out of the bag then anyway. 

So i dunno, share my IG clips. Remote editing work would be dope (I do happen to be one of the best story editors around, google my work) Can I get a guestie on your bar show?

2714,StandUpComedy,"The Steel City Arts Foundation (better known as Steel City AF) is a live/work/play environment in Pittsburgh for comedians and other artists. Founded in memory of my father, the board of directors includes Elayne Boosler, Josh Wolf, Ali Spagnola, and more. 

&amp;#x200B;

While there, grant recipients will be part of a uniquely supportive comedy community and collaborative space with over 30 active members. You will have access to a world-class podcasting studio, a full gym, A/V equipment, editing software, a green screen studio, a zoom studio, and more. Each comedian is paired with a mentor, and you'll also be able to join writing groups, classes, and writer's mics (as well as be considered for shows our members produce all over Pittsburgh). 

&amp;#x200B;

Why Pittsburgh? Pittsburgh has a burgeoning arts scene and low cost of living, is within a six-hour drive of 18 other comedy markets, and is a short flight from more than half the population of the US and Canada. It is a physically gorgeous city, filled with mountains and rivers and stunning views. Pittsburgh is a lot like the average stand-up comedian: gritty, full of heart, and constantly underestimated.

&amp;#x200B;

Steel City AF is growing - we shot our first feature film in December, and several of our members got to work on set and appear in it. We'll be producing our first annual comedy festival in June, and we are bringing in headliners from around the country to perform with our members. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can apply (or find out more) at [SteelCityAF.com](https://SteelCityAF.com).

Please pass this along to any comedian you may know.

2824,StandUpComedy,"I recently went to Chris Delia's stand up show at Daytona. Pretty funny overall. But I got kind of annoyed by the political jokes. I usually don't mind political jokes. It's when you only target one side that annoys me. And this set was definitely pandering to conservatives only. 

Chris joked about how it's stupid to wear masks outside since you can't get covid outside (false). Half the room Clapped, did loud ass whistles and were shouting ""PREACH"". I know its a joke from chris. But his audience actually believed that as fact. They are completely unaware of people who have immune disorders or are vulnerable. Most of the people doing the whistling and shouting were drunk men, and they were LOUD. I'm guessing these are the type of men to bully people wearing a mask, and chris just made them feel justified in doing that. Not Chris's fault though. 

Then they were screaming at Chris to move out of commie LA because he was joking about how LA sucks. Except just before chris joking about LA sucking, Chris also joked about how Florida is just like LA too.. Guess they missed that part and only hear what they want to.

Oh and can't forget about Chris complaining how
 he was cancelled and people in the audience cheered, acting like he was cancelled over nothing.

Overall, good show from him. The few trans jokes weren't distasteful were actually funny. The jokes about his kid were funny and adorable, too. The audience was the ones that really sucked.

The worst was the comedian that came on before Chris. 90% of his jokes were political. He asked if there were any Trump supporters and the whole room blew up in applause and clapping. He asked if there were biden supporters and few clapped. The ones who clapped for biden got booed and yelled at. Which is funny because I was told by comedians we shouldn't shame people for political beliefs? But whatever I guess that's fine now.

So the comedian decided to bash on Biden and Harris the whole time since the crowd was largely Trump supporters. And when he was doing that I could hear the ""oh yea preach! Biden is scum and need to be in prison"", and loud whistling right in my ear all because they want to bang Trump. and it just added a really hostile vibe to the auditorium. Seriously, these loud drunk men would not stfu about biden after the dude moved on from politics. I could hear a bunch of then ranting about biden around me like they're at their family Thanksgiving dinner again.

So yeah, is this just a regional thing or is it going to be like this every Chris show I go to? I like his jokes overall. But the audience he has kind of sucks. And before you call me some sjw, I don't mind political jokes. I just think it's a problem when you only target one side. Then it turns the room hostile. Joke about both sides then it won't be. It's that simple. And I won't get loud drunk men screaming and ranting in my ear right behind me too.

Sorry guys, just wanted to vent a bit. 

TL;DR comedians doing one sided political jokes are annoying because it turns the room hostile and encourages loud drunk people to say whatever they want. Also I don't like drunk men screaming ""PREACH"" in my ear. Political jokes are fine as long as you dont make it one-sided.",Getting annoyed by political jokes at shows now because of the audience..,"I recently went to Chris Delia's stand up show at Daytona.

The quote/sample says ""Who hasn't gone on a PCP binge and shot at a couple of cops, come on..""  


I showed it to an older (60+) working comic friend and he swears he's heard the bit, it's referring to James Brown going on a PCP binge, and possibly in reference to his interview(s) after it happened around 1988.  


The artists that sampled it (ICP) are from Detroit, MI and the only answer they've given is it was a ""local comedian after a show,"" but whether or not it was local to MI is beyond me.  


Also, it's a professional recording, so it's very possible that ICP just didn't want to get sued. It doesn't sound local.  


Only google results for the quote are lyrics to this song.  


I don't know how to work Reddit karma but I'll pay if possible.

2887,StandUpComedy,"I  figured out years ago that it takes a lot more than being funny these  days. Firstly comedy shows aren't really a contest of who's funniest, it  really just comes down to who brings the most friends to buy drinks, so  if you're like me and all your friends are broke losers probably in  rehab for their 5th time or they're too busy taking care of babies they  can't afford, than you got to be creative and work around the system.

Also,  I ain't trying to play the race card but... The reality is most  club/bar owners are trust fund white dudes who think their audience just  want to see white and black people talk about the differences between  white and black people, so if you don't fit that description and you're  not bringing that kind of played out material to the stage then the club  owners probably won't notice no matter how many laughs you're getting, I  know from lots of experience.

Tip  one, build your fan club website. Social media is garbage, don't let  them middle man the connection between you and your fans, if you have a  thousand followers, 500 of them are just bots, and maybe 60 of them are  going to see the hilarious idea you just posted, unless you pay to reach  more people. Half of the ""engagements"" are just your family and  coworkers. And every time you link your page anywhere, you're not  promoting yourself, you're promoting that social media service. Most of  the ""view"" counts on tiktok and instagram are fake. They decide who  becomes famous, not your fans, you're just a monkey trying to work the  algorithms and making them relevant and rich in the process.

Anyways,  enough of the conspiracy stuff, be interesting. It's super easy now to  just make your own free website, don't be a cookie cut clone, give  people something interesting to delve into. ""Followers"" are horsesh!t,  newsletter subscribes got things right the first time, 100% of your fans  will see what you post with no middle man taking a bite of your action.

Once  you have your amazing website setup featuring a bunch of art and music  you probably stole, make business cards and hand them out. I hand out  cards to every person that comes up to me after a show, i even hand them  to other comedians who try to pitch me their lame joke before the show  and then I walk away without hearing the rest. Don't be humble, be the  star, otherwise why are you doing this? I drop my cards into mail boxes,  car windows, stick them into bus window seals, I hand them out at  concerts. Make your card funny, one of my cards is designed promote a  fake dating website called Cousins-Mingle and has a silhouette of two  cowboys about to lock lips, that gets them 100% of the time. Nothing  hypes me more than hearing people laugh at my cards when I'm already  yards away on my bicycle.

By the  time you got all that down I'm still out hustling you, I'm putting up  fliers, slapping stickers, I carry a sharpie with me into every public  bathroom I walk into. My web server hosts are sending me text messages  saying ""hey can you tone it down some, your site traffic is overloading  our system man."" I have a label maker, I stick labels into all the new  popular books at the library. I even spam on redbox movie discs.

People  love stuff, no matter how junk that stuff is. I 3d print junk and stuff  them in random places around the city, of course with my website name  embedded into it. Sometimes I just leave that stuff around at bus stops  or wherever, or sometimes I'll hide them well and do scavenger hunts  online. I also have my own comedy CD with 80 minutes of non standup  material I recorded, I randomly hand those out for free to anyone who  comes up to me after I perform. I also have tshirts with my stage name,  sometimes if there's a big audience I will toss one out to someone who  seems to really be enjoying my set.

Ok  you made it to this point and somehow managed to copy my techniques,  I'm still gonna 1up you, I hacked my own phone app that continuously  blasts text messages all day to ranges of phone numbers i program into  it. It's even designed to elude phone companies from knowing it's a bot.  Sometimes that's just what it takes, if you're like me and not  privileged enough to move to LA or NYC to become famous, you gotta hack  your way to fame. Don't let some douchebag trust fund club owner self  identifying comedy expert decide you're not funny enough for his weekend  show, make your own show.

You  can't all be funny and original, and most of you won't ever come close  to being on my level, but umm... what's the point i'm trying to make  here? I don't know, try harder? Don't take it so seriously, if you think  grinding your 5 minutes over and over is going to make you rich and  famous, well that's statistically unlikely. The key to being funny is to  do it just for fun. A lot of my self promotion is worked into my  exercise routines, riding my bicycle around for hours and putting  stickers and fliers is great for building enurance. Crafting all the  things i give out is just a hobby, you don't have to drain your hard  earned day job paycheck into it, buying the materials is far way cheaper  and more effective than buying ads on facebook. There will come a time,  when you got so many followers and their algorithms are playing you so  good, then try to promote your big show and suddenly get hit with a  popup requiring you to pay for people who already follow you to see it,  wtf that's half the money you're probably gonna get paid!

Or  just keep doing things the easy way, keep driving to the same club week  after week, getting on stage holding that over priced watered down beer  hoping the owner notices how good a patron you are, until finally he  chooses you to be an opener for the lame traveling comedian desperate  enough to perform at his dive bar, and when he pays you for the night,  which will be far less than what you've invested into this place so far,  you can feel super validated and brag about it to everyone at work and  they will ask you to tell them a joke and then they will fake laugh at  it.",The real reason I have fans and you don't,"I  figured out years ago that it takes a lot more than being funny these  days.

delve into followers are horsesht  newsletter subscribes got things right the first time 100 of your fans  will see what you post with no middle man taking a bite of your action  once  you have your amazing website setup featuring a bunch of art and music  you probably stole make business cards and hand them out i hand out  cards to every person that comes up to me after a show i even hand them  to other comedians who try to pitch me their lame joke before the show  and then i walk away without hearing the rest dont be humble be the  star otherwise why are you doing this i drop my cards into mail boxes  car windows stick them into bus window seals i hand them out at  concerts make your card funny one of my cards is designed promote a  fake dating website called cousins mingle and has a silhouette of two  cowboys about to lock lips that gets them 100 of the time nothing  hypes me more than hearing people laugh at my cards when im already  yards away on my bicycle  by the  time you got all that down im still out hustling you im putting up  fliers slapping stickers i carry a sharpie with me into every public  bathroom i walk into my web server hosts are sending me text messages  saying hey can you tone it down some your site traffic is overloading  our system man i have a label maker i stick labels into all the new  popular books at the library i even spam on redbox movie discs  people  love stuff no matter how junk that stuff is i 3d print junk and stuff  them in random places around the city of course with my website name  embedded into it sometimes i just leave that stuff around at bus stops  or wherever or sometimes ill hide them well and do scavenger hunts  online i also have my own comedy cd with 80 minutes of non standup  material i recorded i randomly hand those out for free to anyone who  comes up to me after i perform i also have tshirts with my stage name  sometimes if theres a big audience i will toss one out to someone who  seems to really be enjoying my set  ok  you made it to this point and somehow managed to copy my techniques  im still gonna 1up you i hacked my own phone app that continuously  blasts text messages all day to ranges of phone numbers i program into  it its even designed to elude phone companies from knowing its a bot  sometimes thats just what it takes if youre like me and not  privileged enough to move to la or nyc to become famous you gotta hack  your way to fame dont let some douchebag trust fund club owner self  identifying comedy expert decide youre not funny enough for his weekend  show make your own show  you  cant all be funny and original and most of you wont ever come close  to being on my level but umm whats the point im trying to make  here i dont know try harder dont take it so seriously if you think  grinding your 5 minutes over and over is going to make you rich and  famous well thats statistically unlikely the key to being funny is to  do it just for fun a lot of my self promotion is worked into my  exercise routines riding my bicycle around for hours and putting  stickers and fliers is great for building enurance crafting all the  things i give out is just a hobby you dont have to drain your hard  earned day job paycheck into it buying the materials is far way cheaper  and more effective than buying ads on facebook there will come a time  when you got so many followers and their algorithms are playing you so  good then try to promote your big show and suddenly get hit with a  popup requiring you to pay for people who already follow you to see it  wtf thats half the money youre probably gonna get paid  or  just keep doing things the easy way keep driving to the same club week  after week getting on stage holding that over priced watered down beer  hoping the owner notices how good a patron you are until finally he  chooses you to be an opener for the lame traveling comedian desperate  enough to perform at his dive bar and when he pays you for the night  which will be far less than what youve invested into this place so far  you can feel super validated and brag about it to everyone at work and  they will ask you to tell them a joke and then they will fake laugh at  it the real reason i have fans and you dont

For the first time in a long time there are now consistent open mics in my town and it's very exciting. We don't have a ton of comedy on my town and I've always wanted to try my hand at doing comedy after being a fan of standup comedy for years and being in the advanced theater classes at school. I'm 18 years old and enjoyed comedians like George Carlin, Patton Oswalt, John Mulaney, Preacher Lawson, Matt Rife, Lace Larabee, Taylor Tomlinson, Steve Martin and even some musical comedians like Tim Minchin or Bo Burnham. I want to start performing at these shows but have no clue where to begin. 

I’ve watched Jerry Corely and studied a bunch of different comedians and things like that, but I don’t know what to do from here. I have concept ideas for jokes like my college application listing my dead dad as unemployed, but I can’t think of how to make that into a setup and punchline. How can I start writing material and start performing?",What can I do at 18 to start performing standup comedy?,"For the first time in a long time there are now consistent open mics in my town and it's very exciting.

2964,StandUpComedy,"Am I overthinking it? I just feel like there is so much about the comedy that is conveyed through things that are either very different in other cultures, or just subtle things about the annoyances of nuances of English that might not be picked up on without living in the US/Canada/UK/Australia, and really studying for 5+ years. For the same reason I feel like I could study Polish in school, but without living there, I feel like there's no way I could really enjoy a Polish comedian.

I used Poland because I heard a comedian recently talking about doing shows there (Bill Burr maybe), but I also know that Eastern Europe  has a lower % of the population that speak fluent English than say Scandinavian countries. And so I was just a bit shocked to hear that any American comedian could do well there, just due to the aforementioned barriers.

3072,StandUpComedy,"For the record, I’ve supported her for years. Was an avid listener to her main podcast, saw her live (which was great), and bought her books and merch.

Her stand-up is good. You don’t see the “cracks” there. She has been doing this for awhile and has great stage presentation and great jokes. 

However, I think my mistake was following her on social media and listening to her podcast. After a few years, I had to stop. Plus, watching her block and berate people on social media for completely BENIGN things was rough. She went down conspiracy craziness after 2016 (even though I tend to agree with her on most things, politically, it got really wild and unhinged). I even was one of the people on Twitter that she berated because I complimented her and she took it a different way (I have no idea how - it wasn’t covert or a joke - it was a nice genuine compliment 🤷🏻‍♀️). I realized she’s just another liberal white lady who spouts nice sounding philosophies, but cannot self-examine at all. She’s pretty oblivious to her privilege and will double-down on stupid things. Also, she seems like the girl you knew in high school who tried waaaaaaay too hard and you just want to shake her and tell her to chill out and for her to feel better about herself. She is in her late 40s and like this (for the record, I’m close to her age. Some people compare her to Maron (even herself 🤔), but even in recent years, he’s become so much more tame and self-aware. It’s called maturity and growth. Plus, she plays the victim constantly instead of being thankful for the support she does have. 

Every now and then I go back and listen. Maybe she’s grown a bit. Maybe she’s become a bit more self-aware? Nope. I’m amazed she is still like this and sometimes seems to be getting worse.

Anybody else have anything to say about this? I’ll always support her stand-up, but I’m constantly ambivalent about her.",Jen Kirkman Ambivalence,"For the record, I’ve supported her for years.

3094,StandUpComedy,"A long time ago I was listening to a burnt CD that had a comedian on it. He was rather explicit. Here is all I remember:

He talked about “dumb families” on Family Feud. The example used was “Name something you might order at a fast food restaurant.” They answer hamburger then French fries. Whenever it’s the mothers turn to answer they cheer for her by saying “Oh momma in ya a*s!” He says “Where do they find these dumb f*cking families?

He talks about a lottery winner who won 52 million “some a*shole won” and he makes fun of the fact they say they’ll keep there job and then says “F*ck you! I’d be liquor, hookers, and an ounce of cocaine and show you what a lottery winner looks like!”

It seems like his content was loosely based on some things I’ve found from James Gregory however this guys is much more loud and vulgar. If I had to say the closet speaking it sounded like I would say Rodney Carrington. 

Not much to go on, does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!",Help me find / identify stand up comedian!,"A long time ago I was listening to a burnt CD that had a comedian on it. He was rather explicit.

3150,StandUpComedy,"Tl;dr- for the first time ever, I had a good set. Crowd didn't go wild or anything, but I got genuine laughs right off the bat and kept the crowd with me for the whole 4 mins. I now have a much better understanding of why this might be worth any number of bombs. Feels good, man lol

So, I've been trying stand up for about 4 months now. I haven't been diligent on hitting every open mic, though, and so I haven't found any solid footing to start building off of. I've been burning through new, half-baked bits everytime, which means I haven't been able to work on my stage presence or even really get use to the nerves and the lights in the eyes, etc. etc. 

Now after I've been bombing every attempt so far, with a one or two being some legit L's that were hard to swallow
I was probably going to call it quits after tonight. My city has got a pretty healthy comedy scene, so it's likely you'll always have enough fresh faces to keep the audience from becoming stagnate, but there is the core community of comedians you'll start running into everywhere. A community of people all going to the same places as you and who will see everyone of those bombs, making the idea to just not show your face again look pretty tempting.

Anyway, there's not much more to it. I wrote out a little outline last night and just kept running over it in my head all day today, trying to only bust out the notepad for a reminder or if I had a very specific thing write down, but otherwise just kinda let my memory do some shaving down for me, and then when I got to the open mic, I made significant effort to actually just sit and listen to the other comedians and not think about my stuff until I got up there.

And let me tell you, even though tonight was minor,  getting the crowd invested, interested, and laughing with you- one of the most amazing highs ever lol I went from dreading tonight, even secretly giving myself permission to go ahead and call it quits at the end of it to being all smiles and feeling like I'll explode before I can get to another open mic.

Nothing special, just wanted to brag little and who knows, maybe someone will read this who needs a little reminder not to give up 

Peace homies","Just had my first ""successful"" set at a Open Mic and hooooooooolllllly......","Tl;dr  for the first time ever, I had a good set.

3226,StandUpComedy,"
Have you ever wondered why stand up comedians choose stand up comedy? Probably not, but if you indulge me I’d like to pontificate my best guess (as someone with a PhD who researched interpersonal emotion for 7 years). It’s important to note that what I’m about to say does not apply to everyone, but rather a general trend I’ve seen watching thousands of hours of stand up and listening to many comedians on their podcasts (e.g., WTF, Professor Blastoff, Monday Morning Pocast, JRE, Tiger Belly, You Made it Weird, etc. etc.). 

Essentially it all gets boiled down to a few key components - namely heightened sensitivity coupled with significant amounts of shame. Let’s get the easy one out of the way - most stand up comics are particularly sensitive - they observe the world and recognize its subtlety perhaps more so than the average person. This alone does not create a stand up - many highly sensitive people are drawn to a number of different professions in both the arts and elsewhere. The key ingredient is shame, and how that shame interacts with their heightened sensitivity.

People who are highly sensitive and prone to shame tend to experience many things personally that others would not. A dirty look from a stranger on the bus may not affect the average person to the extent it affects these shame-prone individuals, immediately grappling with the possibility they did something to induce the look, rather than writing it off as someone simply having a bad day. This trend is particularly observed in the Borderline Personality Disorder presentation, where the DBT-Linehan model would argue is manifested from early childhood invalidation - most likely from a primary caregiver or parent. (Disclaimer - I am not saying all stand up comics have BPD, because BPD has significantly more symptomatology to consider, however there are some transdiagnostic similarities). 

As a consequence of this unfortunate combination of sensitivity + shame-proneness, and similarly observed in individuals with BPD, taking things “personally” so often leads to conflict in relationships, family, friends, etc…. Ultimately though it all stems from this heightened sensitivity to shame, and that is what I’ll be talking about for the most part moving forward. 

If you want to know what shame is, look up Brene Brown. To paint the emotion with broad strokes though, there are two main components and one main belief surrounding the emotion. Shame is first and foremost a social emotion, meaning it requires an observer for the induction to take place. Often, if not most of the time, this observer is imagined, projected,or even just another part of ourselves (e.g., our superego, or whatever). Coupled with the inherent social aspect of shame is the action behavior, which can be summed up simply as “hide.” When we feel shame, our action urge is to hide. If you pee your pants in 4th grade during lunch, your first concern is not that your pants are wet, it is that someone will see that your pants are wet. And so we hide when we feel shamed. Last, and most important, is the belief component coupled with shame, and that is “Something is wrong with me.” This thought is often latent when shame is experienced, and oftentimes is pushed down immediately with some sort of counter-belief that there is nothing wrong with you, however just to simply engage in the discussion and grapple with the idea implies there is a part of you that believes it. 

So what does this all have to do with stand up comics? My theory, that I just pulled out of my ass, is that a lot of stand up comics are drawn to the craft because they are unconsciously trying to get rid of their own shame by exposing it via the art of stand up. Think about shame again. What exactly is the antidote to shame? Those of you who have listened to a Brene Brown talk (or have experienced it firsthand) know that the antidote to shame is vulnerability. What exactly is the most vulnerable thing a person can do who feels like something is wrong with them? Rather than hide, you show, and there are few artistic expressions as directly vulnerable as stand up comedy. One could argue that all art is equally vulnerable, however stand up is one of the few mediums where the artist is actually just directly presenting a version of themselves - their thoughts, feelings, and observations. A director also reveals themselves in their work, albeit more indirectly than most comics, and their are always exceptions to this characterization (e.g., Gallagher, Carrot Top), however it is hard to deny that speaking into a microphone with just a stool and a bottle of water is perhaps the most stripped-down artistically raw of them all. 

As these stand up comics perfect their craft, the laughter and bombing all point toward the same purpose - exposure of the emotions and thoughts inextricably tied to this feeling of something being “wrong” with them. The laughter validates the counter-belief, whereas the bombing further validates the shame. Over time, however, even the bombing validates the counter-belief, because to expose oneself to such unpleasantness and remain in one piece psychologically inherently builds resilience. 

So how exactly does the laughter validate the belief that there is nothing wrong with them, and that their shame is ill-founded? Consider what laughter communicates to the comic - namely that there is something relatable that the comic is espousing. Laughter is the involuntary admission of recognition, then. Recognition of a shared perspective of observation. When Jerry Seinfeld talks about airline food, we laugh because it is relatable, because it is also part of our experience. If other people can share similar perceptions/thoughts/emotions/whatever, this indicates (through laughter) that the comics experience is not unique to them. Similar to the boy who peed himself in 4th grade, the knowing that others have had this experience too -and by knowing I don’t mean just intellectually, but viscerally knowing - it lessens the sting of it all. You don’t feel as much like something is wrong with you when others experience it too. 

So this is my theory. Comics seek to expose their own shame on the grandest scale. Ultimately this approach tends to backfire as it is an elaborate form of reassurance-seeking, since true validation cannot come from the outside, but within. Generally speaking, this approach to shame exposure likely keeps the individual trapped, since external validation is a never-ending search that leaves one perpetually thirsty. This perpetual thirst then pushes comics to start seeking the laugh by any means necessary, and the whole pursuit of showing your “self” to the public becomes moot because you are no longer even exposing that which you were previously driven to hide.",Why Stand Up Comics Choose Stand Up - Insights from a Clinical Psychologist (and failed stand up),"Have you ever wondered why stand up comedians choose stand up comedy?

This trend is particularly observed in the Borderline Personality Disorder presentation, where the DBT Linehan model would argue is manifested from early childhood invalidation   most likely from a primary caregiver or parent. (Disclaimer   I am not saying all stand up comics have BPD, because BPD has significantly more symptomatology to consider, however there are some transdiagnostic similarities).   As a consequence of this unfortunate combination of sensitivity + shame proneness, and similarly observed in individuals with BPD, taking things “personally” so often leads to conflict in relationships, family, friends, etc…. Ultimately though it all stems from this heightened sensitivity to shame, and that is what I’ll be talking about for the most part moving forward.   If you want to know what shame is, look up Brene Brown. To paint the emotion with broad strokes though, there are two main components and one main belief surrounding the emotion. Shame is first and foremost a social emotion, meaning it requires an observer for the induction to take place. Often, if not most of the time, this observer is imagined, projected,or even just another part of ourselves (e.g., our superego, or whatever). Coupled with the inherent social aspect of shame is the action behavior, which can be summed up simply as “hide.” When we feel shame, our action urge is to hide. If you pee your pants in 4th grade during lunch, your first concern is not that your pants are wet, it is that someone will see that your pants are wet. And so we hide when we feel shamed. Last, and most important, is the belief component coupled with shame, and that is “Something is wrong with me.” This thought is often latent when shame is experienced, and oftentimes is pushed down immediately with some sort of counter belief that there is nothing wrong with you, however just to simply engage in the discussion and grapple with the idea implies there is a part of you that believes it.   So what does this all have to do with stand up comics? My theory, that I just pulled out of my ass, is that a lot of stand up comics are drawn to the craft because they are unconsciously trying to get rid of their own shame by exposing it via the art of stand up. Think about shame again. What exactly is the antidote to shame? Those of you who have listened to a Brene Brown talk (or have experienced it firsthand) know that the antidote to shame is vulnerability. What exactly is the most vulnerable thing a person can do who feels like something is wrong with them? Rather than hide, you show, and there are few artistic expressions as directly vulnerable as stand up comedy. One could argue that all art is equally vulnerable, however stand up is one of the few mediums where the artist is actually just directly presenting a version of themselves   their thoughts, feelings, and observations. A director also reveals themselves in their work, albeit more indirectly than most comics, and their are always exceptions to this characterization (e.g., Gallagher, Carrot Top), however it is hard to deny that speaking into a microphone with just a stool and a bottle of water is perhaps the most stripped down artistically raw of them all.   As these stand up comics perfect their craft, the laughter and bombing all point toward the same purpose   exposure of the emotions and thoughts inextricably tied to this feeling of something being “wrong” with them. The laughter validates the counter belief, whereas the bombing further validates the shame. Over time, however, even the bombing validates the counter belief, because to expose oneself to such unpleasantness and remain in one piece psychologically inherently builds resilience.   So how exactly does the laughter validate the belief that there is nothing wrong with them, and that their shame is ill founded? Consider what laughter communicates to the comic   namely that there is something relatable that the comic is espousing. Laughter is the involuntary admission of recognition, then. Recognition of a shared perspective of observation. When Jerry Seinfeld talks about airline food, we laugh because it is relatable, because it is also part of our experience. If other people can share similar perceptions/thoughts/emotions/whatever, this indicates (through laughter) that the comics experience is not unique to them. Similar to the boy who peed himself in 4th grade, the knowing that others have had this experience too  and by knowing I don’t mean just intellectually, but viscerally knowing   it lessens the sting of it all. You don’t feel as much like something is wrong with you when others experience it too.   So this is my theory. Comics seek to expose their own shame on the grandest scale. Ultimately this approach tends to backfire as it is an elaborate form of reassurance seeking, since true validation cannot come from the outside, but within. Generally speaking, this approach to shame exposure likely keeps the individual trapped, since external validation is a never ending search that leaves one perpetually thirsty. This perpetual thirst then pushes comics to start seeking the laugh by any means necessary, and the whole pursuit of showing your “self” to the public becomes moot because you are no longer even exposing that which you were previously driven to hide. Why Stand Up Comics Choose Stand Up   Insights from a Clinical Psychologist (and failed stand up)",have you ever wondered why stand up comedians choose stand up comedy probably not but if you indulge me id like to pontificate my best guess as someone with a phd who researched interpersonal emotion for 7 years its important to note that what im about to say does not apply to everyone but rather a general trend ive seen watching thousands of hours of stand up and listening to many comedians on their podcasts eg wtf professor blastoff monday morning pocast jre tiger belly you made it weird etc etc   essentially it all gets boiled down to a few key components   namely heightened sensitivity coupled with significant amounts of shame lets get the easy one out of the way   most stand up comics are particularly sensitive   they observe the world and recognize its subtlety perhaps more so than the average person this alone does not create a stand up   many highly sensitive people are drawn to a number of different professions in both the arts and elsewhere the key ingredient is shame and how that shame interacts with their heightened sensitivity  people who are highly sensitive and prone to shame tend to experience many things personally that others would not a dirty look from a stranger on the bus may not affect the average person to the extent it affects these shame prone

# 2022 I bid you adieu

I’ll be honest with you, trusting reader: it feels pretty good to do one of these end of the year posts without the all too familiar “good riddance, this stupid ass year and hello, arbitrarily numbered upcoming year: Imma make you my BITCH!” At a certain point, the disingenuous core of that fake attitude shines through and it’s just a bit cringy. I can’t help but fall into the trap of assigning meaning to this year because it just so happens to be proof in a 3 year cup of pudding for me. 2020 was so fucking rough for me, and I was not in the mood to overcome all that bullshit (Crohn’s flare up, addiction issues, 2 surgeries, 3 months with a colostomy bag, intensely alone and depressed the whole time) just to get to a starting point of 0 for what I needed to do: build, workout, and eventually tape my best hour. I built and worked it out after moving to Atlanta in March of 2021, recorded in February 2022, and after some bullshit, finally released in November of 2022. It feels so goddam good to be able to say that. And not only that, but with all the tracks in rotation on 3 different channels on XM and an amazing jump off with 6 full album spins (meaning whole album played straight through 6 times) in week one. That’s the way to start the day right there(woo!).

I’m not one for heavy spiritual overtones, but if I hadn’t already had experience in setting goals that were just beyond the horizon and with no road map to guide me toward accomplishing those goals, I don’t know if I could have followed through with how far past the horizon and how vague the path was to get to where I hoped to get on this particular trial and tribulation. I really felt on the cusp of letting myself wither away in my room in bedstuy OR following the pull of the intuitive compass inside my chest pulling me towards Atlanta, towards the Earl, towards the people I needed to work with, and toward a very specific career path that I would be the first person I know to prove to myself it’s a viable one. I know that sounds crazy, or maybe dramatic, but I don’t know anyone that made the same plans as me, much less someone to watch pave the away ahead of me, reassuring me that it’s doable. Now I know that it’s more doable than I had initially hoped, which never fucking happens to me. 

Ok, I will try not to be vague here for the sake of others wondering what career paths are viable in stand up comedy. Of course, I think everyone should know that there truly is no set path to “making it” and I don’t even know what you have in your head as what “making it” is, but everyone should come to terms with the good and bad sides of how true that is, that there is no set path to a comedy career. On one end, you need not be discouraged if you don’t seem to fit what is often portrayed to be the path to comedy success. If you are like me and mysteriously unbookable for all supposed comedy stepping stone up &amp; coming comedians on the rise/look out for these new faces of comedy’s future showcase festivals as decided by industry gate keepers with the power to “make” whoever they think they’ve discovered...don’t worry. Not only is it possible to have a career without being tapped by a future outted sex offender type, that whole model is completely hollow. That is all pomp and pageantry that doesn’t predict the future of comedy at all. On occasion, they happen to see the talent in a talented person that would’ve gone onto to do big things with their talent regardless, and then people reverse engineer what was causation and correlation or whatever. My point is, don’t fucking shed one tear over not getting New Faces, or wonder if you should quit because Comedy Central told you in a meeting that they just don’t know what to do with you, but hey you are funny. And yes, that’s me I am referencing there. My intuition told me to let my stubbornness take the wheel and laugh at those execs when they said that to me, because at the time Comedy Central was everything and to accept reality at that moment would mean I was just informed for sure that I had no chance at a career in comedy. Luckily, I have to do this anyway, and as it turned out, Comedy Central ain’t shit now and is only going to be less relevant to anyone in the world of stand up going forward. That’s the good part about there being no set path: you can’t know for a fact that you’re screwed. The downside is of course that you can’t be sure what is a viable approach until you know where that approach leads. And now I will stop gumflappin and explain my personal path I’ve decided to thwack through the comedy woods.

One aspect of comedy that you can bet your bottom dollar on is that you can’t really rely on shit. Everything is so precarious and quick-sandy. So many big things almost happen before the bottom falls out. Even live shows that you have already done make you nervous until that check clears. One of the only dependable sources of income in comedy for me personally has been residuals through the world of comedy audio. Over the years, my monthly sound exchange deposit has only become more and more crucial to my survival, and it’s at the heart of any possibly viable shot at making the kind of passive income where I could do more than just get by, but could actually see myself having real money to retire on and continue to grow. It took a couple albums that I worked very hard on and years of experience learning how XM and Pandora and the world of comedy audio itself works to not just be able to pay my rent and bills with my monthly deposit, but to see a path and timeline that could be very lucrative and actually doable, though not easy at all. In 2018, I released my second album and first special, Shameful Information, and my first album, Me The Whole Time, was still getting played on XM quite a bit, so for 2018/19 I was averaging an all time high for me on my monthly deposits. Well life kept happening to me as it does, and I had never had to think along the lines of any timeline beyond check to check my whole life, so yada yada, by the time pandemic hit and my deposits started to dip down some and I had no other income, and no plan or real possible way to be ready to record a next album that would be anywhere up to snuff, much less better than my last one (always my goal), I had to think about how to start gettin busy working toward my next best hour, and I knew that best case scenario, I wouldn’t have a whole grip of new tracks being added to rotation for at least a couple years. And as things tend to go, I was thrown into much worse than the best case scenario, so it’s really a miracle that I only had to suffer a more or less 5 year gap. The longest gap I will ever allow moving forward, I assure you. However, even with that damn near 5 year gap, I am still covering rent and bills with my deposit having no tracks newer than 2018. That goes to show the staying power of comedy audio if you put in the effort to make a good album. That showed me that if I can bust my ass to record a quality album every 2 to 2 and a half years, I won’t just be playing catch up, I will be stacking paper more and more with each album. 

Basket Case came out in November, and I will start getting money from those tracks in February and March, and my hope to get back to where I was in 2018/19 and then work on the next album to put me over that mark turned out to be wrong in the best way. The good news is, I will be making the money I hoped to be making in 2024/25 by February 2023. That is wonderful news, but no reason to think I added time to the clock. It’s all about keeping the quality up anyway, but that happens to be an obsession of mine that I can’t not shoot for. I’m just putting all this down on record here to let whoever needs to know that a career in comedy without fame or celebrity or the average person even knowing who you are is very possible. I am that comedian. Only comedy nerds know me, and I really don’t mind that at all. I want everyone who would love my shit to be able to find my shit and see me in person. Beyond that, everyone else can kick rocks. I don’t need em. I’ve been poor as shit most of my life, and I am about to be richer than I ever thought I would be. I feel lucky as hell that I can’t help myself from doing what some would consider an insane amount of work, but it isn’t work to me. It never will be. That’s dumb luck, ya know?

Do me a favor: Don’t follow your fucking dreams. Dreams are nonsense: follow your obsession, and figure out some way to satisfy that obsession so that it pays you well enough to not have to actually work just so that you can do that thing. If that isn’t possible in the end, turn to non-violent crime. That’s what I’d do. Anything but soul draining jobs that make other people money. Do whatever you can to have money and not let money have you. Don’t be afraid to lean toward the less safe route. Having a financial safety net won’t save you from being miserable. Do whatever ya gotta do, just don’t do what you wanna do any less. That’s all you’ll regret in the end, believe me. You heard it here: 2023 is gonna be great. Imma start dispensing rhyming wisdom, for real. 

Follow your obsession, fight off your depression.

toodles 2022!

\-Andy",Never give up! Andy Sandford,"Read this from Andy Sandford and rather than copying his website link I am posting the whole thing.  Great words from Andy.   [**andysandfordcomedy**](  # 2022 I bid you adieu  I’ll be honest with you, trusting reader: it feels pretty good to do one of these end of the year posts without the all too familiar “good riddance, this stupid ass year and hello, arbitrarily numbered upcoming year: Imma make you my BITCH!” At a certain point, the disingenuous core of that fake attitude shines through and it’s just a bit cringy. I can’t help but fall into the trap of assigning meaning to this year because it just so happens to be proof in a 3 year cup of pudding for me. 2020 was so fucking rough for me, and I was not in the mood to overcome all that bullshit (Crohn’s flare up, addiction issues, 2 surgeries, 3 months with a colostomy bag, intensely alone and depressed the whole time) just to get to a starting point of 0 for what I needed to do: build, workout, and eventually tape my best hour. I built and worked it out after moving to Atlanta in March of 2021, recorded in February 2022, and after some bullshit, finally released in November of 2022. It feels so goddam good to be able to say that. And not only that, but with all the tracks in rotation on 3 different channels on XM and an amazing jump off with 6 full album spins (meaning whole album played straight through 6 times) in week one. That’s the way to start the day right there(woo!).  I’m not one for heavy spiritual overtones, but if I hadn’t already had experience in setting goals that were just beyond the horizon and with no road map to guide me toward accomplishing those goals, I don’t know if I could have followed through with how far past the horizon and how vague the path was to get to where I hoped to get on this particular trial and tribulation. I really felt on the cusp of letting myself wither away in my room in bedstuy OR following the pull of the intuitive compass inside my chest pulling me towards Atlanta, towards the Earl, towards the people I needed to work with, and toward a very specific career path that I would be the first person I know to prove to myself it’s a viable one. I know that sounds crazy, or maybe dramatic, but I don’t know anyone that made the same plans as me, much less someone to watch pave the away ahead of me, reassuring me that it’s doable. Now I know that it’s more doable than I had initially hoped, which never fucking happens to me.   Ok, I will try not to be vague here for the sake of others wondering what career paths are viable in stand up comedy. Of course, I think everyone should know that there truly is no set path to “making it” and I don’t even know what you have in your head as what “making it” is, but everyone should come to terms with the good and bad sides of how true that is, that there is no set path to a comedy career. On one end, you need not be discouraged if you don’t seem to fit what is often portrayed to be the path to comedy success. If you are like me and mysteriously unbookable for all supposed comedy stepping stone up & coming comedians on the rise/look out for these new faces of comedy’s future showcase festivals as decided by industry gate keepers with the power to “make” whoever they think they’ve discovered...don’t worry. Not only is it possible to have a career without being tapped by a future outted sex offender type, that whole model is completely hollow. That is all pomp and pageantry that doesn’t predict the future of comedy at all. On occasion, they happen to see the talent in a talented person that would’ve gone onto to do big things with their talent regardless, and then people reverse engineer what was causation and correlation or whatever. My point is, don’t fucking shed one tear over not getting New Faces, or wonder if you should quit because Comedy Central told you in a meeting that they just don’t know what to do with you, but hey you are funny. And yes, that’s me I am referencing there. My intuition told me to let my stubbornness take the wheel and laugh at those execs when they said that to me, because at the time Comedy Central was everything and to accept reality at that moment would mean I was just informed for sure that I had no chance at a career in comedy. Luckily, I have to do this anyway, and as it turned out, Comedy Central ain’t shit now and is only going to be less relevant to anyone in the world of stand up going forward. That’s the good part about there being no set path: you can’t know for a fact that you’re screwed. The downside is of course that you can’t be sure what is a viable approach until you know where that approach leads. And now I will stop gumflappin and explain my personal path I’ve decided to thwack through the comedy woods.  One aspect of comedy that you can bet your bottom dollar on is that you can’t really rely on shit. Everything is so precarious and quick sandy. So many big things almost happen before the bottom falls out. Even live shows that you have already done make you nervous until that check clears. One of the only dependable sources of income in comedy for me personally has been residuals through the world of comedy audio. Over the years, my monthly sound exchange deposit has only become more and more crucial to my survival, and it’s at the heart of any possibly viable shot at making the kind of passive income where I could do more than just get by, but could actually see myself having real money to retire on and continue to grow. It took a couple albums that I worked very hard on and years of experience learning how XM and Pandora and the world of comedy audio itself works to not just be able to pay my rent and bills with my monthly deposit, but to see a path and timeline that could be very lucrative and actually doable, though not easy at all. In 2018, I released my second album and first special, Shameful Information, and my first album, Me The Whole Time, was still getting played on XM quite a bit, so for 2018/19 I was averaging an all time high for me on my monthly deposits. Well life kept happening to me as it does, and I had never had to think along the lines of any timeline beyond check to check my whole life, so yada yada, by the time pandemic hit and my deposits started to dip down some and I had no other income, and no plan or real possible way to be ready to record a next album that would be anywhere up to snuff, much less better than my last one (always my goal), I had to think about how to start gettin busy working toward my next best hour, and I knew that best case scenario, I wouldn’t have a whole grip of new tracks being added to rotation for at least a couple years. And as things tend to go, I was thrown into much worse than the best case scenario, so it’s really a miracle that I only had to suffer a more or less 5 year gap. The longest gap I will ever allow moving forward, I assure you. However, even with that damn near 5 year gap, I am still covering rent and bills with my deposit having no tracks newer than 2018. That goes to show the staying power of comedy audio if you put in the effort to make a good album.

3371,StandUpComedy,"I run an open mic, and last week this woman came up to me before the mic and said she's brand new to standup, and very politely asked if I could watch her set and give her some feedback, so of course I said yes.  


I don't want to be harsh, she's brand new and we all have to start somewhere, but her set didn't even have any real jokes. She just kind of talked for a while about her coworkers, and then she started talking about her family and her boyfriend...some of the stories felt like there could be some opportunity for humor, some didn't, but none of them went anywhere or turned into an actual joke, or even an attempt at a joke. 

When I talked with her afterwards, I told her in the nicest way I could that she needs to write some sort of punchlines. From her face and the questions she asked it was clear she didn't understand what a punchline is, so I started trying to define it, but I don't think she got it. I tried telling her that it's the payoff to the set up, that it's some sort of an unexpected twist, it's the thing that makes you laugh, but I don't think any of those things made it any clearer for her. I've never thought of that word as some sort of insider comedy lingo, I thought it was something everyone understood, so I was honestly kind of shocked to see someone interested enough in comedy to try standup who was totally unaware of the most basic concepts of it. If she comes back again this week I'd like to be able to explain it better, how would you guys explain that concept to someone who'd never heard of it?","How would you explain what a ""punchline"" is to someone who doesn't understand?","I run an open mic, and last week this woman came up to me before the mic and said she's brand new to standup, and very politely asked if I could watch her set and give her some feedback, so of course I said yes.

I just finished writing a 5 min set and am getting ready to take it to open mics. I am still trying to figure out how to deliver them and was wondering if it's better to memorize the material first and then worry about how to deliver or if I figure out how to deliver the joke and then memorize both the joke and the way it is delivered? 

Or maybe I'm just overthinking as a way to procrastinate going to an open mic b/c I'm kind of terrified lol. 

Do you have any advice regarding memorizing material / working on delivery?

3437,StandUpComedy," 

I turn 18 in January and I finally want to pursue what I've always wanted to try and that's standup comedy. I've been wanting to try comedy since I was about 14 or 15, but that was when we were balldeep in COVID and quarantine lockdowns, and I clearly couldn't do any shows during that time. Now that COVID lockdowns seem to have become a thing of the past and I'm graduating high school here in the next six months, I figured ""What the hell, let's give this a shot.""

I do have onstage experience. The entire time I've been in high school, I did theater and currently, I'm in the advanced class and known for writing funny plays for in class performances. I was asked to help edit/add jokes to the script for a school assembly, so I hope that those experiences/skills would help me out in doing standup comedy. During lockdown, I found discovered some of my favorite comedians like Steve Martin, Taylor Tomlinson, Iliza Schlesinger and I already had my favorite comics that I already knew like Preacher Lawson, Drew Lynch, George Carlin, Robin Williams, John Mulaney, and Patton Oswalt. I'm sure that if I sit and think about it more, I could list more comics.

I started thinking of premises that had potential and one of my favorites recently is the fact that on my college application, my father was listed as both unemployed AND deceased, with his end of employment (naturally) being the day he died. I found that so fucked up/hilarious that I wrote it down, but I don't know how to turn it into actual jokes. That's the hang up for me is that I don't know how I'm going to actually start writing. Everything I've tried just doesn't sound funny, so nothing is ever written. What can I do to figure out writing so that I can start performing?",How can I start doing comedy as an 18 year old?,"I turn 18 in January and I finally want to pursue what I've always wanted to try and that's standup comedy.

3493,StandUpComedy,"Several of my friends are standup comedians and were trying to tell me there are tricks (as in physical or techniques) that aren't necessarily related to the actual written jokes themselves. From what I could gather some were:

- One said he does 'crowd work' and can pretend that he heard or misheard someone's response. For example, he asks where everyone was from and although nobody said 'Dildo, Newfoundland' he'll act like he heard that ""Wait.. did you just say your towns name is 'Dildo?' (apparently this is a real town name somewhere near that particular club).

- Another told me that he can actually get laughs by laughing at the joke. He says he even has a joke he knows is going to bomb with a difficult audience so he'll do it and just as the punchline leaves his mouth he sort of 'falls over' like he can't keep it together and laughs close into the microphone. He said, he can even do that a second time after any laughs (at his laugh) and it will illicit laughs. So in a sense, people will 'laugh at laughing' even if there is no actual joke itself.  (this seems weird but I'm pretty sure that's what he said more or less).

- He also said you can get some people to laugh by sheer physical movements and sounds. I agreed like yes of course people laugh at physical comedy etc. He says no, no really like that. Like if he tells a joke (again, possibly weak or he knows the audience will not like it) he can pump it up just by sort of 'walking it'. Like actually physically move with the sentences and then actually physically appear to lurch forward and at the punchline .. well literally 'punch' the line. like punch at the audience into the air. 

- Another 'trick' if you will was where a guy said, if he can see a really harsh crowd. He will deliberately unzip his fly or another version is he misbuttons his shirt. He says, almost every single time, even the deadest audience, this tricks at least one person to shout it out or engage. He even has preplanned things like he'll pretend not to catch what they said and say ""A fly? theres a fly on me"" or ""you want to press my buttons what?"".  

Mind you, the latter seems more like just actual physical comedy but I see what they mean. These are like 'tricks' that don't have anything to do with the actual written jokes or 'the act' or bits or whatever you call it.

Anyway, I found that totally fascinating! The problem is we all had to get going and I may not see them for a while. I need to know more!

3638,StandUpComedy,"Never really knew who she was but the I remember the Mrs watching the tv show Glaser had 5 or so years ago. She was recently brought back into our homes via a competition she was recently on (don't want to spoil anything), but the whole competition, I thought she was very annoying and unoriginal. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and I get an email from a local venue giving away free tickets to Nikki Glaser. I enter for s&amp;g since I figure the Mrs would enjoy the show. 

I end up winning the tickets, we find a sitter and attend the show. The opener, Anya something, sang a few songs but really only talked about how she has songs in movies and tv shows, that was the whole thing...???? It was weird. Then after on stage for only 17 minutes, Nikki comes in duet style with her mic turned up to 11 just destroying everyone's ears! Couldn't hold the note, no vibrato, all bad. The thing is, she wasnt trying to be funny, she was actually trying to sing.

Then the jokes started.........or should I say ""jokes""?

It was the same unoriginal 3 jokes that she stretches and re-tells to make last 90 minutes!!!! At the one hour mark of being bored out of my mind, the Mrs gives me ""the look"" and we bail so we can beat the traffic. 

Was it fine for free? I guess?

Am I an ass or do I not understand comedy? It wasn't like she was offending me or anything. It just felt like listening to a girl at a bar talk non-stop for an hour.

3723,StandUpComedy,"I've noticed this recent obsession of many people with ""punching up"" in humor, as if that's a pre-requisite for even validating your attempts at humor. I see a fundamental problem with that - it shifts the inherent focus of humor from its very core - being funny - to something different. What exactly? Well, if you insist that humor should only be directed at those in power, then you come across as seeking to use humor as a way of venting your frustration, or have a momentary feeling of taking back a bit of the power that the wealthy and powerful have. It's a nice feeling, sure, but it has nothing to do with something being *funny.*   


Recently, many people have adopted an ideological stance that the perceived unfortunate must be propped up at all costs, and never brought down - and the rich and powerful, never deserving of what they have, should be brought down. This conviction permeates many, many domains of daily life. But when it comes to humor - these people fail to notice that rules of morality should fly out the window. There is only one purpose that humor has - to make people laugh. The inability to understand that seemingly cruel, insensitive or wicked humor does not have to align with the person's actual views, and some people simply find that kind of humor funny - largely due to understanding that most of the time *you don't mean it.*   


Enjoying shock humor is not something to be judged in terms of morality. This simple truth is drowning in a sea of moral judgment by a puritanical majority, and it's for all intents and purposes, *contrary to the spirit of humor as a whole*. If at least part of you, on some level, can't laugh at say, people who stutter, or how people with cerebral palsy act - you are a humorless person. I can understand that sometimes laughing at something may feel bad or leave you conflicted (probably the source of all those ""I'm going to hell"" comments), but that just proves funniness and morality are simply at odds with each other some of the time - and we need to embrace that part of humor instead of trying to erase it for fear of making someone feel sad or put down.   


South Park's joke about Sarah Jessica Parker, calling her a ""transvestite donkey witch"", wasn't funny becasue it was directed at a highly wealthy and successful woman. It was funny because of the creative insult and choice of words - it would have been *equally as funny* if directed at a poor, destitute woman working 2 jobs to make ends meet and bogged down by crippling student debt. Who it is about is *simply not the point.* That's my point :D   


Humor is about being funny and making you laugh, not about fostering sensitivity to human misfortune and indignation at injustice. Not everything in life needs to be evaluated in terms of oppressors vs oppressed. Agree or not?","Punching down is funny. Nay, who you punch is not even relevant to the funniness.","I've noticed this recent obsession of many people with ""punching up"" in humor, as if that's a pre requisite for even validating your attempts at humor.

3737,StandUpComedy,"So on a whim, I decided to try stand up at an open mic last night and I had a lot of fun. I know I probably wasn't very funny, I didn't write anything, I just completely winged it. Thankfully, I'm not the nervous type, and I have no shame and don't care if I bomb. I mostly just ranted, and while I did get some laughs, I noticed my rants didn't really set up a punchline or a zinger, So I was thinking about going to another open mic tonight and building on what I started yesterday but adding like a punchline to the end of a rant. But besides that self critique, I really don't know anything about stand up, I do watch some stand up and my favorite comedian is Gary Gulman. So just curious to hear from some of you who are more experienced than I am... What are some things a beginner should know/think about when attempting stand up for the first couple times? Any advice?

I started a YouTube channel to upload podcasts about tips for mental health and people struggling from depression/anxiety. I try to use motivational speaking with a mix of comedy thrown in to lighten the mood. 

I don’t do this for fame or money or any of that shit. I want to try to help people in the same shoes that I am in. 

Do you think this is something that people would possibly listen to? Do you guys think this is something that would be able to help people?

With everyone here being from the comedy world I figured this would be a good place to ask.

I’m not sure really where to post this so I figured I would try here and see if I can get some insight from anyone. 

If anyone here struggles with mental health, would this be something that could maybe help you? Try to relieve some stress from your everyday life while also trying to help people?

If this is against the rules please let me know so I can delete it but I’m just trying to get some outsider knowledge on this as I’m completely new to this.

4 months into living here, and I like the area, but the comedy scene is kinda... meh. 

Don't get me wrong, you can hit the mics 2-3x a night, there's clubs, Rogan's new joint is opening in a couple months, and you do see some industry rub shoulders with us lowly open mikers. You can find something to like in ATX, but the scene is already oversaturated with people from all over the country and most of the open mics suck. The ones that are good, like the mics that the clubs run, are heavily curated to the point that it's just the same people on every week unless if you show up 3-4 hours early to get on stand-by. Even Kill Tony is overrated. 

But I hear from some folks that Denver is a better spot. Smaller city and less run down, with a strong comedy presence, but one that isn't over saturated with Rogan/Hinchcliffe cultists, and of course, legal weed.

3886,StandUpComedy,"Recently I’ve seen people trying to cancel normal people and comedians for jokes. And I think it’s stupid.
A joke can be as offensive as the joke teller wants.

A joke is at the expense of someone.
A joke is offensive to someone.
A joke does not have to approved by everyone’s feelings to be funny.

I don’t get what these people want by trying to draw a line in comedy.
Do they want to live in a world where absolutely no one is allowed to make fun of any other persons appearance, culture, likes, dislikes?

Where does that slippery slope lead?

Eventually you won’t be able to make a joke about an animal because people will be offended for them.
Eventually you won’t be able to tell a joke about an inanimate object because someone who used that object will be offended.

In the great words of Kyle Broflovski “either it’s all okay, or none of it is”

In the great words of Micheal Scott “you don’t call retarded people retards. It’s bad taste. You call your friends retards when they’re acting retarded.”

3904,StandUpComedy,"Hey Sebastian, it only got “quiet” because you simply stopped talking. I get it… You obviously did that intentionally to start your bit, but there is no logic in the way you set it up. Are you implying that just because you said there was an “Asian man” the crowd should have immediately erupted in laughter? Did you really try to gaslight your viewers into thinking there’s something wrong with society if they don’t laugh simply because you said a person was “Asian” with no relevant context before or after? 

All this tells me about Sebastian Maniscalco is that he is apparently legit racist against Asians—not in the oversensitive “can’t-take-a-joke” sense, but in a legitimate “actually racist” sense. 

There really is no other logical way to explain that bit about one third into his latest special. It was basically a cringey lecture by Sebastian that people must be uptight if they don’t burst out laughing at the mere mention of an Asian man. 🤔

I know this will probably go down as an unpopular opinion, but this guy’s schtick is getting increasingly old and dried out. His earlier specials were pretty hilarious. Seems like he ran out of witty and snappy funny things to say/do and is now relying on the ever-tiresome “angry comedian because it’s society’s fault” routine. That may be partly true, but in this particular case, no Sebastian it’s because you’re just not that funny anymore.
