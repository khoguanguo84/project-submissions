so give it to me, any thing that I should focus on improving?

I’m scared when I go back I’m gonna shake again and be just as nervous. When does that go away— if it even does? Then somebody said I did fine just get the delivery down? I thought I practiced the delivery all day and the day before??? I guess this is a dumb question but what is the simplest way to describe delivery??

StandUpComedy,"I’m surprised I haven’t seen anyone point this out yet, though it’s pretty obvious. 

Traditionally the types of people who move to LA are narcissistic, 100% dedicated to image and brand, “influencer” vibes, etc. 

**This is why LA comics tend to tell Stories in funny voices instead of actual observations and good joke structure**. 

And this is why all the LA comedy podcasts have completely dissolved into shit shows and consist of some of the most unlikable characters ever. There’s no bits, no authentic friendships / riffing, and they’re all over produced and forced. 

Note: NYC comics are so much better that Tuesdays with Stories has remained fresh and an S tier podcast after 10 years a despite literally being stories…",I figured out why LA comedy / Comedy podcasts are so terrible compared to NYC comedy and podcasts

He was bombing and so I called out “you’re bombing dude”

Then he said

“I’m gonna light your ass up frat boy”

So I told him to go ahead. And he recycled some joke I’ve heard a bunch of times about being someone who’d be at the capital riot.

So I said I’ve heard that joke a million times.

I’ve been doing stand up for about a year and a half now and it’s been going well. I really feel myself getting better at finding my voice and I’m starting to travel outside my comfort zone for more gigs to see if my jokes travel beyond where I’m always gigging. 

Recently, I’ve been having trouble though as my dad recently passed away which has resulted in a lot of things in my life changing at a pace I can’t control. All my friends in stand up suggested I take a break and I took a month off, and have now recently started to come back and get my stride back. I really want to keep gigging because stand up is my passion and I always feel great being able to turn things that have happened to me into funny jokes that an audience enjoys, but I feel like eventually I’m going to have to bring up my Dad on stage (as in jokes, I’m not bringing up his ashes) 

Dead relative jokes I imagine would be a really tough sell in comedy clubs, especially if you’re not someone who’s used to doing dark humour. My style’s more cheeky and likable funny according to booker feedback and I keep worrying that suddenly bringing up a dead relative in my set would go against my stage persona, but I know I’ll have to do jokes about him if I want to keep being authentic and relatable on stage. 

Is this something any of you guys have had to do before and even if not, any advice you could give would be massively helpful.",My dad recently died and I feel like I have to joke about it

FIRST, he said ""tell people I told you to say the N-word,"" presumably so that he'd get cancelled. Huh? Do comedians run around telling people to yell the n-word? Is that a thing? 

Also, if the bit is about him not giving a fuck and being that non-black comedian talking about race, shouldn't he just say the actual word and not ""n-word?"" Laced with jokes of course. Like what Carlin did back in the day.

SECOND... MAGA idiots cancel people? What? Isn't it well known that it's always the extreme left that does the cancelling? And that MAGA guys are the ones who always talk AGAINST cancel culture, like to the point that it's already annoying? 

BTW, I'm not from America. I just follow the pop culture news, so I might be missing something. Thanks!","First time posting on the sub. Just wanted to share my thoughts on Ronny Chieng's ""Cancel Me"" bit."

- I’ve been 26 for a few hours now and so far it fucking sucks….. Not because of ‘fuck I am almost thirty’ crisis. But because my parent’s health insurance no longer wants me, and neither does Leonardo DiCaprio


As I get closer to thirty I realize we actually have two puberties. The physical puberty in our teens, and then the emotional puberty in our 20’s. You’re perpetually depressed and horny in both, except one makes your face look like peperoni pizza, and the later makes your joints crack during sex
 

The word clonic in my stage name is a former term for a grand mal seizure. I’m an epileptic, which just means I’ve mastered the art of the hokey pokey
 

Fucking an epileptic is great. I once had a seizure riding my ex, and my pussy was squeezing his cock harder than a cop chokes his wife


 *Who here is queer*
Great this place just became a gay bar  
                    	Or
       Impossible; no one is 100% straight
 
 

I blame high school band for making me queer. It was there I learned to finger and blow
 


If you couldn’t tell I am Jew…ish. As in the only prerequisite to be Jew..ish is to be a comedian


As a queer Jew, hiding in the closet is part of my cultural identity.


I am originally from New Jersey….. New Jersey doesn’t trust you with pumping your own gas, but trusts you enough to pump your own cousin. And you thought Alabama was weird.


As a teenager with nothing better to do in New Jersey my friends and I went dumpster diving. Moving to New York I learned that dumpster diving just means Apartment hunting.


I am studying to be a math teacher. And the only benefit of marrying a teacher is having health insurance.

*Anyone here in therapy?*
 My therapist is great, but I only do comedy because therapy isn’t enough.


*Who here take antidepressants?*
Being on anti-depressants and in a sexual relationship, you never know if the anti-depressant is making it difficult to cum, or if they just suck in bed",My show script so far

Hey there, I wanted to share something with you that's really important to me. I recently started a YouTube channel called HubNonsense, and it's all about showcasing the funniest and goofiest stand-up comedy clips from a variety of comedians.

Starting a new channel is always a bit nerve-wracking, and it's hard to get noticed in the sea of content out there. That's why I'm reaching out to you today - I could really use your help in spreading the word about my channel.

I truly believe that HubNonsense has something special to offer. It's all about bringing joy and laughter into people's lives, which I think is something we could all use a little more of right now.

The channel features short clips of the best jokes from a variety of stand-up comedians, so there's something for everyone. And the best part is that I upload new content every single day, so there's always something fresh and funny to check out.

The community around the channel is already growing into a supportive and fun-loving group of people, and I would be honored to have you be a part of it.

So if you have a few minutes to spare, I'd be so grateful if you could check out HubNonsense and share it with your friends and family. Every new subscriber and view helps me to keep creating more content and bringing more joy into the world.

Thank you so much for your support, and I hope you enjoy the channel!

StandUpComedy,So many videos you see that are popular on Instagram/Tiktok/Twitter or even this sub is some compilation of a click bait title like “Drunk lady in Kansas…” and then the video of the comedian dealing with the person. IMO a lot of comedians are just trying to post content without having to release their jokes online. That being said I think that most people don’t really understand the nuance between crowd work and heckling so I’ve noticed a lot more people just yelling shit out to try and get some attention at shows.

StandUpComedy,"okay, this happened about two years ago (woah) - but I'm posting about it now because I'm about to do a ""Science Standup"" routine. Basically, it's regular stand-up but it has to be about something science-based, and **I'm looking for opinions on how to make this story into that.** 

So about two years ago, I (now 29f), was on my way to pick up some friends and head to FL. It was a cold morning and I noticed my tires needed some air, so I decided to stop at a gas station to fill them up. I pulled up next to the air pump machine and kept my car turned on with my phone inside while I filled up (it was 8 am on a Thursday in Virginia Highlands -  who tf is out stealing cars?). Right before I got out of the car, I swear to God, I remembered this NPR story I had heard a few weeks before about how Uber eats drivers were getting their cars stolen because they just leave them running while they go in to grab the food. Why that thought didn't prompt me from saving myself? Who knows. 

As I'm filling up my tires I look over to my right and I notice this angry girl coming out of Buddies. She's about my height, a white girl, with brown hair, with a black puffer jacket on - just like me. In my head I'm like what's this girl's problem? But I figure she's just pissed off because she left her wallet at home or some shit. I continue pumping air into my tires and notice my tires start ROLLING AWAY. I look up and there this girl is in the drivers seat, just casually backing my car away like it was her car!!! She's like putting her arm over the passenger seat, backing out, looks right past me like I didn't exist. Just a casual morning drive for her. 

I instinctively scream at the top of my lungs and hit the windshield super hard with the palm of my hand (cracked my window) and she just drives away with the vehicle. 

So I'm freaking out, someone calls the cops on their phones yada yada. I sprint home in socks and sandals (about a 10 minute run at this point) and grab my MacBook to text my friends the reason why I'm not there to pick them up yet. My boyfriends talking to the cops at my house while I'm on his work phone talking to my friends about the situation. 

My friends remember they have my phone location so they tell me they're going to follow the tracker. They're driving around, asking me about my car, what color it is, what type, etc., and as I'm describing it they're like ""wait.. does it have a side swipe?"" (it does). They're like ""holy shit we found your fucking car!!!"". We tell the cop, who tells us to hop into their car to go check out the crime scene (I should mention it's fucking April fool's day). 

We get to my car (across the street from the exact location I was originally heading to), it's still on, and nothing was taken (I had like three bags in there since I was going on vacation). The bags weren't even TOUCHED. My phone was still missing but we ended up finding that in the park nearby. What's weird is that it seems she turned my phone off, turned it back on, then threw it out the window into the park. I know this because when I turn my phone back on my contacts are missing for a little bit until I start to use it for a little while. 

All this happened within an hour of the car getting stolen, and the girl was never found. I have a few theories since the girl looked eerily similar to me and it was so fucking weird. Either I time-traveled to try to stop myself from going to Florida, or I went mentally insane and stole my own car. 

**How tf do I turn this into 'science stand-up'?** 

Also - always turn off your car and take your keys, purse, and phone with you everywhere you go.",carjacked in Atlanta for like an hour

StandUpComedy,"There’s tumbleweed rolling around Jim’s sub so thought there’d be more discussion on it here 

He’s probably my favourite comedian - or certainly top 2 with Louis CK 

But I find the older, sober Jim very tame versus his absolutely wild and hilarious earlier standup specials 

I did love the way he bookended references to Greta 

And his storytelling is still top tier 

It’s just that he’s now 45 and those stories don’t seem to be as interesting as before 

I’ll need to watch it again in a few months to decide, but at the moment - for me - it’s his weakest standup special

I know the tech has existed for years to automatically generate multiple levels of associations that branch out, given a word prompt to start with.  Like ""tree --&gt; leaves --&gt; divorce --&gt; alimony"". So each subsequent level as this expands out only associates words with the word next to it.  Especially now with GPT3, there has to be an app that you can feed a couple words into to get this output that you can then scan for connections, instead of laboriously doing the word cloud part yourself first.

StandUpComedy,"I've been a reporter for The Pulse, a science show made by WHYY that airs on NPR stations for five years. I helped edit SERUM, an excellent limited-run investigative podcast.

I also do stand up mostly local to Philly and New York. I post reels on my IG @ JadSlay, (about an hour's worth at this point) A lot of clips here too.

My boss /team all knew and didn't care. My stage name is just my first name, last initial, Jad S (Arabic last name, tough for hosts). I never talk about work.

But recently I got called into a meeting with no warning and fired on the spot for ""egregious violations of WHYY values"" because of those reels. Guess some exec(s)/director(s) of whatever saw them? I dunno.

My act isn't clean, deals with dark stuff, I'm a former Marine, an Arab Muslim from West Virginia and I used to be a war correspondent and EMT.

But in all my clips it's a room full of people laughing. (They’re all clips where I’m doing well obviously)

I told them I’m a complete unknown, no real fan base. If you’re at my level and try to do true edge lord stuff, you just bomb. I told them I get booked at black shows, gay clubs, up in the Poconos for old white people, everybody has fun.

 Isn’t the laughter proof you're overreacting?

They didn't care, it's like they mentally edited out the audience. If I'm so shitty for telling these jokes, what's that make the laughing crowd?

My work knows I recently got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (had some trouble walking, stable atm tho) and losing my job means it's back to the VA hospital that's not really designed for that. 

They flat didn't give a shit. It was kind of unreal just how enraged they were (again, not my team or my actual boss). 

I dont think your employer should have a say in your off hours creative expression(unless you like shit talk them), but at the same time I wouldve changed my byline or stage name, whatever. Didn't get a chance. They said the meeting was over.

This all seems like a kind of moral extremism to me. You watch clips of a show that a diverse room full of people is enjoying and your reaction to that is... blind fury? 

You go yeah for his jokes this guy needs to lose his livelihood and his doctors.  I feel like these people would take me out back and shoot me if they could get away with it.

The VA has improved over the years so fingers crossed on that.

But I told them I wouldn't let them do this quietly. Ive been a journalist for 13 years and if I ever want to work in media again they'll ask why I was fired and it's out of the bag then anyway. 

So i dunno, share my IG clips. Remote editing work would be dope (I do happen to be one of the best story editors around, google my work) Can I get a guestie on your bar show?

Each comedian is paired with a mentor, and you'll also be able to join writing groups, classes, and writer's mics (as well as be considered for shows our members produce all over Pittsburgh). 

&amp;#x200B;

Why Pittsburgh? Pittsburgh has a burgeoning arts scene and low cost of living, is within a six-hour drive of 18 other comedy markets, and is a short flight from more than half the population of the US and Canada. It is a physically gorgeous city, filled with mountains and rivers and stunning views. Pittsburgh is a lot like the average stand-up comedian: gritty, full of heart, and constantly underestimated.

&amp;#x200B;

Steel City AF is growing - we shot our first feature film in December, and several of our members got to work on set and appear in it. We'll be producing our first annual comedy festival in June, and we are bringing in headliners from around the country to perform with our members. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can apply (or find out more) at [SteelCityAF.com](https://SteelCityAF.com). 

&amp;#x200B;

Please pass this along to any comedian you may know.

And thank you for reading!

StandUpComedy,"I recently went to Chris Delia's stand up show at Daytona. Pretty funny overall. But I got kind of annoyed by the political jokes. I usually don't mind political jokes. It's when you only target one side that annoys me. And this set was definitely pandering to conservatives only. 

Chris joked about how it's stupid to wear masks outside since you can't get covid outside (false). Half the room Clapped, did loud ass whistles and were shouting ""PREACH"". I know its a joke from chris. But his audience actually believed that as fact. They are completely unaware of people who have immune disorders or are vulnerable. Most of the people doing the whistling and shouting were drunk men, and they were LOUD. I'm guessing these are the type of men to bully people wearing a mask, and chris just made them feel justified in doing that. Not Chris's fault though. 

Then they were screaming at Chris to move out of commie LA because he was joking about how LA sucks. Except just before chris joking about LA sucking, Chris also joked about how Florida is just like LA too.. Guess they missed that part and only hear what they want to.

Oh and can't forget about Chris complaining how
 he was cancelled and people in the audience cheered, acting like he was cancelled over nothing.

Overall, good show from him. The few trans jokes weren't distasteful were actually funny. The jokes about his kid were funny and adorable, too. The audience was the ones that really sucked.

The worst was the comedian that came on before Chris. 90% of his jokes were political. He asked if there were any Trump supporters and the whole room blew up in applause and clapping. He asked if there were biden supporters and few clapped. The ones who clapped for biden got booed and yelled at. Which is funny because I was told by comedians we shouldn't shame people for political beliefs? But whatever I guess that's fine now.

So the comedian decided to bash on Biden and Harris the whole time since the crowd was largely Trump supporters. And when he was doing that I could hear the ""oh yea preach! Biden is scum and need to be in prison"", and loud whistling right in my ear all because they want to bang Trump. and it just added a really hostile vibe to the auditorium. Seriously, these loud drunk men would not stfu about biden after the dude moved on from politics. I could hear a bunch of then ranting about biden around me like they're at their family Thanksgiving dinner again.

So yeah, is this just a regional thing or is it going to be like this every Chris show I go to? I like his jokes overall. But the audience he has kind of sucks. And before you call me some sjw, I don't mind political jokes. I just think it's a problem when you only target one side. Then it turns the room hostile. Joke about both sides then it won't be. It's that simple. And I won't get loud drunk men screaming and ranting in my ear right behind me too.

Sorry guys, just wanted to vent a bit. 

TL;DR comedians doing one sided political jokes are annoying because it turns the room hostile and encourages loud drunk people to say whatever they want. Also I don't like drunk men screaming ""PREACH"" in my ear. Political jokes are fine as long as you dont make it one-sided.",Getting annoyed by political jokes at shows now because of the audience..

The quote/sample says ""Who hasn't gone on a PCP binge and shot at a couple of cops, come on..""  


I showed it to an older (60+) working comic friend and he swears he's heard the bit, it's referring to James Brown going on a PCP binge, and possibly in reference to his interview(s) after it happened around 1988.  


The artists that sampled it (ICP) are from Detroit, MI and the only answer they've given is it was a ""local comedian after a show,"" but whether or not it was local to MI is beyond me.  


Also, it's a professional recording, so it's very possible that ICP just didn't want to get sued. It doesn't sound local.  


Only google results for the quote are lyrics to this song.

StandUpComedy,,A 100% dad joke
StandUpComedy,"I  figured out years ago that it takes a lot more than being funny these  days. Firstly comedy shows aren't really a contest of who's funniest, it  really just comes down to who brings the most friends to buy drinks, so  if you're like me and all your friends are broke losers probably in  rehab for their 5th time or they're too busy taking care of babies they  can't afford, than you got to be creative and work around the system.

Also,  I ain't trying to play the race card but... The reality is most  club/bar owners are trust fund white dudes who think their audience just  want to see white and black people talk about the differences between  white and black people, so if you don't fit that description and you're  not bringing that kind of played out material to the stage then the club  owners probably won't notice no matter how many laughs you're getting, I  know from lots of experience.

Tip  one, build your fan club website. Social media is garbage, don't let  them middle man the connection between you and your fans, if you have a  thousand followers, 500 of them are just bots, and maybe 60 of them are  going to see the hilarious idea you just posted, unless you pay to reach  more people. Half of the ""engagements"" are just your family and  coworkers. And every time you link your page anywhere, you're not  promoting yourself, you're promoting that social media service. Most of  the ""view"" counts on tiktok and instagram are fake. They decide who  becomes famous, not your fans, you're just a monkey trying to work the  algorithms and making them relevant and rich in the process.

Anyways,  enough of the conspiracy stuff, be interesting. It's super easy now to  just make your own free website, don't be a cookie cut clone, give  people something interesting to delve into. ""Followers"" are horsesh!t,  newsletter subscribes got things right the first time, 100% of your fans  will see what you post with no middle man taking a bite of your action.

Once  you have your amazing website setup featuring a bunch of art and music  you probably stole, make business cards and hand them out. I hand out  cards to every person that comes up to me after a show, i even hand them  to other comedians who try to pitch me their lame joke before the show  and then I walk away without hearing the rest. Don't be humble, be the  star, otherwise why are you doing this? I drop my cards into mail boxes,  car windows, stick them into bus window seals, I hand them out at  concerts. Make your card funny, one of my cards is designed promote a  fake dating website called Cousins-Mingle and has a silhouette of two  cowboys about to lock lips, that gets them 100% of the time. Nothing  hypes me more than hearing people laugh at my cards when I'm already  yards away on my bicycle.

By the  time you got all that down I'm still out hustling you, I'm putting up  fliers, slapping stickers, I carry a sharpie with me into every public  bathroom I walk into. My web server hosts are sending me text messages  saying ""hey can you tone it down some, your site traffic is overloading  our system man."" I have a label maker, I stick labels into all the new  popular books at the library. I even spam on redbox movie discs.

People  love stuff, no matter how junk that stuff is. I 3d print junk and stuff  them in random places around the city, of course with my website name  embedded into it. Sometimes I just leave that stuff around at bus stops  or wherever, or sometimes I'll hide them well and do scavenger hunts  online. I also have my own comedy CD with 80 minutes of non standup  material I recorded, I randomly hand those out for free to anyone who  comes up to me after I perform. I also have tshirts with my stage name,  sometimes if there's a big audience I will toss one out to someone who  seems to really be enjoying my set.

Ok  you made it to this point and somehow managed to copy my techniques,  I'm still gonna 1up you, I hacked my own phone app that continuously  blasts text messages all day to ranges of phone numbers i program into  it. It's even designed to elude phone companies from knowing it's a bot.  Sometimes that's just what it takes, if you're like me and not  privileged enough to move to LA or NYC to become famous, you gotta hack  your way to fame. Don't let some douchebag trust fund club owner self  identifying comedy expert decide you're not funny enough for his weekend  show, make your own show.

You  can't all be funny and original, and most of you won't ever come close  to being on my level, but umm... what's the point i'm trying to make  here? I don't know, try harder? Don't take it so seriously, if you think  grinding your 5 minutes over and over is going to make you rich and  famous, well that's statistically unlikely. The key to being funny is to  do it just for fun. A lot of my self promotion is worked into my  exercise routines, riding my bicycle around for hours and putting  stickers and fliers is great for building enurance. Crafting all the  things i give out is just a hobby, you don't have to drain your hard  earned day job paycheck into it, buying the materials is far way cheaper  and more effective than buying ads on facebook. There will come a time,  when you got so many followers and their algorithms are playing you so  good, then try to promote your big show and suddenly get hit with a  popup requiring you to pay for people who already follow you to see it,  wtf that's half the money you're probably gonna get paid!

Or  just keep doing things the easy way, keep driving to the same club week  after week, getting on stage holding that over priced watered down beer  hoping the owner notices how good a patron you are, until finally he  chooses you to be an opener for the lame traveling comedian desperate  enough to perform at his dive bar, and when he pays you for the night,  which will be far less than what you've invested into this place so far,  you can feel super validated and brag about it to everyone at work and  they will ask you to tell them a joke and then they will fake laugh at  it.",The real reason I have fans and you don't

StandUpComedy,"I  mean let's face it, 98% of y'all are lame, you're just copying each  other over and over, and your jokes are just slight variations of the  same played out material you are subconsciously unaware you stole from  someone else.

I have more fans  than any of you and am far more accomplished in comedy, and life in  general. Ooh look you're getting so triggered already, hey it's not my  fault your jokes are weak.

StandUpComedy,"
For the first time in a long time there are now consistent open mics in my town and it's very exciting. We don't have a ton of comedy on my town and I've always wanted to try my hand at doing comedy after being a fan of standup comedy for years and being in the advanced theater classes at school. I'm 18 years old and enjoyed comedians like George Carlin, Patton Oswalt, John Mulaney, Preacher Lawson, Matt Rife, Lace Larabee, Taylor Tomlinson, Steve Martin and even some musical comedians like Tim Minchin or Bo Burnham. I want to start performing at these shows but have no clue where to begin. 

I’ve watched Jerry Corely and studied a bunch of different comedians and things like that, but I don’t know what to do from here. I have concept ideas for jokes like my college application listing my dead dad as unemployed, but I can’t think of how to make that into a setup and punchline. How can I start writing material and start performing?",What can I do at 18 to start performing standup comedy?

StandUpComedy,"i remember James Acaster the British comedian was talking about this. he was saying when he was on the James cordon show the American audience took his pauses as pauses to laugh but they were a pause to make it seem more awkward and hence improve the final joke. even small sentences like ""i cannot believe my luck"" and ""thank you"" gets laughs stopping his set just look at the difference between a [US audience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlf3XMg6Ltg) and the [British one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt5qJC1xQ8A) here. Does anyone know why the US laugh at every small thing? also why do the US audience applaud so much?",why do Americans laugh so much?
StandUpComedy,"Am I overthinking it? I just feel like there is so much about the comedy that is conveyed through things that are either very different in other cultures, or just subtle things about the annoyances of nuances of English that might not be picked up on without living in the US/Canada/UK/Australia, and really studying for 5+ years. For the same reason I feel like I could study Polish in school, but without living there, I feel like there's no way I could really enjoy a Polish comedian.

I used Poland because I heard a comedian recently talking about doing shows there (Bill Burr maybe), but I also know that Eastern Europe  has a lower % of the population that speak fluent English than say Scandinavian countries. And so I was just a bit shocked to hear that any American comedian could do well there, just due to the aforementioned barriers. 

Thoughts?","How do American comedians do shows in somewhere like Poland, for example, where the culture is so different, but also just the nuance of tone + body language + facial cues + colloquialism/slang surely would cause issues?"

We are uncertain who the comedian was. 

In the bit he describes going to this crazy back room brothal or strip club in mexico maybe? and the lady being very pushy and shouting ""look at my pussy"" and demanding he does it.

StandUpComedy,"As  a comedian and artist of sorts, I am often frustrated when trying to  post my work around reddit, most subs can be annoyingly super strict  about self promotion.

It's like so  many people complain that Hollywood just keeps rebooting and rehashing  old ideas, but at the same time those people don't bother to support  underground artists. So I started a new sub for DIY comedians and  artists who feel they are TV worthy but are tired of the gatekeepers

[r/trickelodeon](https://www.reddit.com/r/trickelodeon/)

I  know it's not the first sub reddit out there for self promotion, but I  have lots of ideas how we can build a community that will grow large and  become a legit place for determined comedians and artists to gain a  real audience.

I know Theo Vaughn has been on it and I believe Joe Rogan has previously ‘judged’ on it. They also would give joke books big and small to the ones they liked and sometimes an amateur would get a show booked on the spot by one of the judges. Can you help me!??

StandUpComedy,"For the record, I’ve supported her for years. Was an avid listener to her main podcast, saw her live (which was great), and bought her books and merch.

Her stand-up is good. You don’t see the “cracks” there. She has been doing this for awhile and has great stage presentation and great jokes. 

However, I think my mistake was following her on social media and listening to her podcast. After a few years, I had to stop. Plus, watching her block and berate people on social media for completely BENIGN things was rough. She went down conspiracy craziness after 2016 (even though I tend to agree with her on most things, politically, it got really wild and unhinged). I even was one of the people on Twitter that she berated because I complimented her and she took it a different way (I have no idea how - it wasn’t covert or a joke - it was a nice genuine compliment 🤷🏻‍♀️). I realized she’s just another liberal white lady who spouts nice sounding philosophies, but cannot self-examine at all. She’s pretty oblivious to her privilege and will double-down on stupid things. Also, she seems like the girl you knew in high school who tried waaaaaaay too hard and you just want to shake her and tell her to chill out and for her to feel better about herself. She is in her late 40s and like this (for the record, I’m close to her age. Some people compare her to Maron (even herself 🤔), but even in recent years, he’s become so much more tame and self-aware. It’s called maturity and growth. Plus, she plays the victim constantly instead of being thankful for the support she does have. 

Every now and then I go back and listen. Maybe she’s grown a bit. Maybe she’s become a bit more self-aware? Nope. I’m amazed she is still like this and sometimes seems to be getting worse.

He talked about “dumb families” on Family Feud. The example used was “Name something you might order at a fast food restaurant.” They answer hamburger then French fries. Whenever it’s the mothers turn to answer they cheer for her by saying “Oh momma in ya a*s!” He says “Where do they find these dumb f*cking families?

He talks about a lottery winner who won 52 million “some a*shole won” and he makes fun of the fact they say they’ll keep there job and then says “F*ck you! I’d be liquor, hookers, and an ounce of cocaine and show you what a lottery winner looks like!”

It seems like his content was loosely based on some things I’ve found from James Gregory however this guys is much more loud and vulgar. If I had to say the closet speaking it sounded like I would say Rodney Carrington.

StandUpComedy,"Tl;dr- for the first time ever, I had a good set. Crowd didn't go wild or anything, but I got genuine laughs right off the bat and kept the crowd with me for the whole 4 mins. I now have a much better understanding of why this might be worth any number of bombs. Feels good, man lol

So, I've been trying stand up for about 4 months now. I haven't been diligent on hitting every open mic, though, and so I haven't found any solid footing to start building off of. I've been burning through new, half-baked bits everytime, which means I haven't been able to work on my stage presence or even really get use to the nerves and the lights in the eyes, etc. etc. 

Now after I've been bombing every attempt so far, with a one or two being some legit L's that were hard to swallow
I was probably going to call it quits after tonight. My city has got a pretty healthy comedy scene, so it's likely you'll always have enough fresh faces to keep the audience from becoming stagnate, but there is the core community of comedians you'll start running into everywhere. A community of people all going to the same places as you and who will see everyone of those bombs, making the idea to just not show your face again look pretty tempting.

Anyway, there's not much more to it. I wrote out a little outline last night and just kept running over it in my head all day today, trying to only bust out the notepad for a reminder or if I had a very specific thing write down, but otherwise just kinda let my memory do some shaving down for me, and then when I got to the open mic, I made significant effort to actually just sit and listen to the other comedians and not think about my stuff until I got up there.

And let me tell you, even though tonight was minor,  getting the crowd invested, interested, and laughing with you- one of the most amazing highs ever lol I went from dreading tonight, even secretly giving myself permission to go ahead and call it quits at the end of it to being all smiles and feeling like I'll explode before I can get to another open mic.

Nothing special, just wanted to brag little and who knows, maybe someone will read this who needs a little reminder not to give up

StandUpComedy,"
Have you ever wondered why stand up comedians choose stand up comedy? Probably not, but if you indulge me I’d like to pontificate my best guess (as someone with a PhD who researched interpersonal emotion for 7 years). It’s important to note that what I’m about to say does not apply to everyone, but rather a general trend I’ve seen watching thousands of hours of stand up and listening to many comedians on their podcasts (e.g., WTF, Professor Blastoff, Monday Morning Pocast, JRE, Tiger Belly, You Made it Weird, etc. etc.). 

Essentially it all gets boiled down to a few key components - namely heightened sensitivity coupled with significant amounts of shame. Let’s get the easy one out of the way - most stand up comics are particularly sensitive - they observe the world and recognize its subtlety perhaps more so than the average person. This alone does not create a stand up - many highly sensitive people are drawn to a number of different professions in both the arts and elsewhere. The key ingredient is shame, and how that shame interacts with their heightened sensitivity.

People who are highly sensitive and prone to shame tend to experience many things personally that others would not. A dirty look from a stranger on the bus may not affect the average person to the extent it affects these shame-prone individuals, immediately grappling with the possibility they did something to induce the look, rather than writing it off as someone simply having a bad day. This trend is particularly observed in the Borderline Personality Disorder presentation, where the DBT-Linehan model would argue is manifested from early childhood invalidation - most likely from a primary caregiver or parent. (Disclaimer - I am not saying all stand up comics have BPD, because BPD has significantly more symptomatology to consider, however there are some transdiagnostic similarities). 

As a consequence of this unfortunate combination of sensitivity + shame-proneness, and similarly observed in individuals with BPD, taking things “personally” so often leads to conflict in relationships, family, friends, etc…. Ultimately though it all stems from this heightened sensitivity to shame, and that is what I’ll be talking about for the most part moving forward. 

If you want to know what shame is, look up Brene Brown. To paint the emotion with broad strokes though, there are two main components and one main belief surrounding the emotion. Shame is first and foremost a social emotion, meaning it requires an observer for the induction to take place. Often, if not most of the time, this observer is imagined, projected,or even just another part of ourselves (e.g., our superego, or whatever). Coupled with the inherent social aspect of shame is the action behavior, which can be summed up simply as “hide.” When we feel shame, our action urge is to hide. If you pee your pants in 4th grade during lunch, your first concern is not that your pants are wet, it is that someone will see that your pants are wet. And so we hide when we feel shamed. Last, and most important, is the belief component coupled with shame, and that is “Something is wrong with me.” This thought is often latent when shame is experienced, and oftentimes is pushed down immediately with some sort of counter-belief that there is nothing wrong with you, however just to simply engage in the discussion and grapple with the idea implies there is a part of you that believes it. 

So what does this all have to do with stand up comics? My theory, that I just pulled out of my ass, is that a lot of stand up comics are drawn to the craft because they are unconsciously trying to get rid of their own shame by exposing it via the art of stand up. Think about shame again. What exactly is the antidote to shame? Those of you who have listened to a Brene Brown talk (or have experienced it firsthand) know that the antidote to shame is vulnerability. What exactly is the most vulnerable thing a person can do who feels like something is wrong with them? Rather than hide, you show, and there are few artistic expressions as directly vulnerable as stand up comedy. One could argue that all art is equally vulnerable, however stand up is one of the few mediums where the artist is actually just directly presenting a version of themselves - their thoughts, feelings, and observations. A director also reveals themselves in their work, albeit more indirectly than most comics, and their are always exceptions to this characterization (e.g., Gallagher, Carrot Top), however it is hard to deny that speaking into a microphone with just a stool and a bottle of water is perhaps the most stripped-down artistically raw of them all. 

As these stand up comics perfect their craft, the laughter and bombing all point toward the same purpose - exposure of the emotions and thoughts inextricably tied to this feeling of something being “wrong” with them. The laughter validates the counter-belief, whereas the bombing further validates the shame. Over time, however, even the bombing validates the counter-belief, because to expose oneself to such unpleasantness and remain in one piece psychologically inherently builds resilience. 

So how exactly does the laughter validate the belief that there is nothing wrong with them, and that their shame is ill-founded? Consider what laughter communicates to the comic - namely that there is something relatable that the comic is espousing. Laughter is the involuntary admission of recognition, then. Recognition of a shared perspective of observation. When Jerry Seinfeld talks about airline food, we laugh because it is relatable, because it is also part of our experience. If other people can share similar perceptions/thoughts/emotions/whatever, this indicates (through laughter) that the comics experience is not unique to them. Similar to the boy who peed himself in 4th grade, the knowing that others have had this experience too -and by knowing I don’t mean just intellectually, but viscerally knowing - it lessens the sting of it all. You don’t feel as much like something is wrong with you when others experience it too. 

So this is my theory. Comics seek to expose their own shame on the grandest scale. Ultimately this approach tends to backfire as it is an elaborate form of reassurance-seeking, since true validation cannot come from the outside, but within. Generally speaking, this approach to shame exposure likely keeps the individual trapped, since external validation is a never-ending search that leaves one perpetually thirsty. This perpetual thirst then pushes comics to start seeking the laugh by any means necessary, and the whole pursuit of showing your “self” to the public becomes moot because you are no longer even exposing that which you were previously driven to hide.",Why Stand Up Comics Choose Stand Up - Insights from a Clinical Psychologist (and failed stand up)

# 2022 I bid you adieu

I’ll be honest with you, trusting reader: it feels pretty good to do one of these end of the year posts without the all too familiar “good riddance, this stupid ass year and hello, arbitrarily numbered upcoming year: Imma make you my BITCH!” At a certain point, the disingenuous core of that fake attitude shines through and it’s just a bit cringy. I can’t help but fall into the trap of assigning meaning to this year because it just so happens to be proof in a 3 year cup of pudding for me. 2020 was so fucking rough for me, and I was not in the mood to overcome all that bullshit (Crohn’s flare up, addiction issues, 2 surgeries, 3 months with a colostomy bag, intensely alone and depressed the whole time) just to get to a starting point of 0 for what I needed to do: build, workout, and eventually tape my best hour. I built and worked it out after moving to Atlanta in March of 2021, recorded in February 2022, and after some bullshit, finally released in November of 2022. It feels so goddam good to be able to say that. And not only that, but with all the tracks in rotation on 3 different channels on XM and an amazing jump off with 6 full album spins (meaning whole album played straight through 6 times) in week one. That’s the way to start the day right there(woo!).

I’m not one for heavy spiritual overtones, but if I hadn’t already had experience in setting goals that were just beyond the horizon and with no road map to guide me toward accomplishing those goals, I don’t know if I could have followed through with how far past the horizon and how vague the path was to get to where I hoped to get on this particular trial and tribulation. I really felt on the cusp of letting myself wither away in my room in bedstuy OR following the pull of the intuitive compass inside my chest pulling me towards Atlanta, towards the Earl, towards the people I needed to work with, and toward a very specific career path that I would be the first person I know to prove to myself it’s a viable one. I know that sounds crazy, or maybe dramatic, but I don’t know anyone that made the same plans as me, much less someone to watch pave the away ahead of me, reassuring me that it’s doable. Now I know that it’s more doable than I had initially hoped, which never fucking happens to me. 

Ok, I will try not to be vague here for the sake of others wondering what career paths are viable in stand up comedy. Of course, I think everyone should know that there truly is no set path to “making it” and I don’t even know what you have in your head as what “making it” is, but everyone should come to terms with the good and bad sides of how true that is, that there is no set path to a comedy career. On one end, you need not be discouraged if you don’t seem to fit what is often portrayed to be the path to comedy success. If you are like me and mysteriously unbookable for all supposed comedy stepping stone up &amp; coming comedians on the rise/look out for these new faces of comedy’s future showcase festivals as decided by industry gate keepers with the power to “make” whoever they think they’ve discovered...don’t worry. Not only is it possible to have a career without being tapped by a future outted sex offender type, that whole model is completely hollow. That is all pomp and pageantry that doesn’t predict the future of comedy at all. On occasion, they happen to see the talent in a talented person that would’ve gone onto to do big things with their talent regardless, and then people reverse engineer what was causation and correlation or whatever. My point is, don’t fucking shed one tear over not getting New Faces, or wonder if you should quit because Comedy Central told you in a meeting that they just don’t know what to do with you, but hey you are funny. And yes, that’s me I am referencing there. My intuition told me to let my stubbornness take the wheel and laugh at those execs when they said that to me, because at the time Comedy Central was everything and to accept reality at that moment would mean I was just informed for sure that I had no chance at a career in comedy. Luckily, I have to do this anyway, and as it turned out, Comedy Central ain’t shit now and is only going to be less relevant to anyone in the world of stand up going forward. That’s the good part about there being no set path: you can’t know for a fact that you’re screwed. The downside is of course that you can’t be sure what is a viable approach until you know where that approach leads. And now I will stop gumflappin and explain my personal path I’ve decided to thwack through the comedy woods.

One aspect of comedy that you can bet your bottom dollar on is that you can’t really rely on shit. Everything is so precarious and quick-sandy. So many big things almost happen before the bottom falls out. Even live shows that you have already done make you nervous until that check clears. One of the only dependable sources of income in comedy for me personally has been residuals through the world of comedy audio. Over the years, my monthly sound exchange deposit has only become more and more crucial to my survival, and it’s at the heart of any possibly viable shot at making the kind of passive income where I could do more than just get by, but could actually see myself having real money to retire on and continue to grow. It took a couple albums that I worked very hard on and years of experience learning how XM and Pandora and the world of comedy audio itself works to not just be able to pay my rent and bills with my monthly deposit, but to see a path and timeline that could be very lucrative and actually doable, though not easy at all. In 2018, I released my second album and first special, Shameful Information, and my first album, Me The Whole Time, was still getting played on XM quite a bit, so for 2018/19 I was averaging an all time high for me on my monthly deposits. Well life kept happening to me as it does, and I had never had to think along the lines of any timeline beyond check to check my whole life, so yada yada, by the time pandemic hit and my deposits started to dip down some and I had no other income, and no plan or real possible way to be ready to record a next album that would be anywhere up to snuff, much less better than my last one (always my goal), I had to think about how to start gettin busy working toward my next best hour, and I knew that best case scenario, I wouldn’t have a whole grip of new tracks being added to rotation for at least a couple years. And as things tend to go, I was thrown into much worse than the best case scenario, so it’s really a miracle that I only had to suffer a more or less 5 year gap. The longest gap I will ever allow moving forward, I assure you. However, even with that damn near 5 year gap, I am still covering rent and bills with my deposit having no tracks newer than 2018. That goes to show the staying power of comedy audio if you put in the effort to make a good album. That showed me that if I can bust my ass to record a quality album every 2 to 2 and a half years, I won’t just be playing catch up, I will be stacking paper more and more with each album. 

Basket Case came out in November, and I will start getting money from those tracks in February and March, and my hope to get back to where I was in 2018/19 and then work on the next album to put me over that mark turned out to be wrong in the best way. The good news is, I will be making the money I hoped to be making in 2024/25 by February 2023. That is wonderful news, but no reason to think I added time to the clock. It’s all about keeping the quality up anyway, but that happens to be an obsession of mine that I can’t not shoot for. I’m just putting all this down on record here to let whoever needs to know that a career in comedy without fame or celebrity or the average person even knowing who you are is very possible. I am that comedian. Only comedy nerds know me, and I really don’t mind that at all. I want everyone who would love my shit to be able to find my shit and see me in person. Beyond that, everyone else can kick rocks. I don’t need em. I’ve been poor as shit most of my life, and I am about to be richer than I ever thought I would be. I feel lucky as hell that I can’t help myself from doing what some would consider an insane amount of work, but it isn’t work to me. It never will be. That’s dumb luck, ya know?

Do me a favor: Don’t follow your fucking dreams. Dreams are nonsense: follow your obsession, and figure out some way to satisfy that obsession so that it pays you well enough to not have to actually work just so that you can do that thing. If that isn’t possible in the end, turn to non-violent crime. That’s what I’d do. Anything but soul draining jobs that make other people money. Do whatever you can to have money and not let money have you. Don’t be afraid to lean toward the less safe route. Having a financial safety net won’t save you from being miserable. Do whatever ya gotta do, just don’t do what you wanna do any less. That’s all you’ll regret in the end, believe me. You heard it here: 2023 is gonna be great. Imma start dispensing rhyming wisdom, for real. 

Follow your obsession, fight off your depression.

toodles 2022!

StandUpComedy,"I run an open mic, and last week this woman came up to me before the mic and said she's brand new to standup, and very politely asked if I could watch her set and give her some feedback, so of course I said yes.  


I don't want to be harsh, she's brand new and we all have to start somewhere, but her set didn't even have any real jokes. She just kind of talked for a while about her coworkers, and then she started talking about her family and her boyfriend...some of the stories felt like there could be some opportunity for humor, some didn't, but none of them went anywhere or turned into an actual joke, or even an attempt at a joke. 

When I talked with her afterwards, I told her in the nicest way I could that she needs to write some sort of punchlines. From her face and the questions she asked it was clear she didn't understand what a punchline is, so I started trying to define it, but I don't think she got it. I tried telling her that it's the payoff to the set up, that it's some sort of an unexpected twist, it's the thing that makes you laugh, but I don't think any of those things made it any clearer for her. I've never thought of that word as some sort of insider comedy lingo, I thought it was something everyone understood, so I was honestly kind of shocked to see someone interested enough in comedy to try standup who was totally unaware of the most basic concepts of it. If she comes back again this week I'd like to be able to explain it better, how would you guys explain that concept to someone who'd never heard of it?","How would you explain what a ""punchline"" is to someone who doesn't understand?"

StandUpComedy," 

I turn 18 in January and I finally want to pursue what I've always wanted to try and that's standup comedy. I've been wanting to try comedy since I was about 14 or 15, but that was when we were balldeep in COVID and quarantine lockdowns, and I clearly couldn't do any shows during that time. Now that COVID lockdowns seem to have become a thing of the past and I'm graduating high school here in the next six months, I figured ""What the hell, let's give this a shot.""

I do have onstage experience. The entire time I've been in high school, I did theater and currently, I'm in the advanced class and known for writing funny plays for in class performances. I was asked to help edit/add jokes to the script for a school assembly, so I hope that those experiences/skills would help me out in doing standup comedy. During lockdown, I found discovered some of my favorite comedians like Steve Martin, Taylor Tomlinson, Iliza Schlesinger and I already had my favorite comics that I already knew like Preacher Lawson, Drew Lynch, George Carlin, Robin Williams, John Mulaney, and Patton Oswalt. I'm sure that if I sit and think about it more, I could list more comics.

I started thinking of premises that had potential and one of my favorites recently is the fact that on my college application, my father was listed as both unemployed AND deceased, with his end of employment (naturally) being the day he died. I found that so fucked up/hilarious that I wrote it down, but I don't know how to turn it into actual jokes. That's the hang up for me is that I don't know how I'm going to actually start writing. Everything I've tried just doesn't sound funny, so nothing is ever written. What can I do to figure out writing so that I can start performing?",How can I start doing comedy as an 18 year old?

They don't have 360 Audio, Dolby ATMOS, or any other high fidelity audio options, so I'm looking to see what else is out there.

Are there any others that offer these options?  TOOL is no longer a consideration since they opened to most services back in 2019.  Suggestions welcome.",Do any music streaming services provide standup comedy channels?

StandUpComedy,"Several of my friends are standup comedians and were trying to tell me there are tricks (as in physical or techniques) that aren't necessarily related to the actual written jokes themselves. From what I could gather some were:

- One said he does 'crowd work' and can pretend that he heard or misheard someone's response. For example, he asks where everyone was from and although nobody said 'Dildo, Newfoundland' he'll act like he heard that ""Wait.. did you just say your towns name is 'Dildo?' (apparently this is a real town name somewhere near that particular club).

- Another told me that he can actually get laughs by laughing at the joke. He says he even has a joke he knows is going to bomb with a difficult audience so he'll do it and just as the punchline leaves his mouth he sort of 'falls over' like he can't keep it together and laughs close into the microphone. He said, he can even do that a second time after any laughs (at his laugh) and it will illicit laughs. So in a sense, people will 'laugh at laughing' even if there is no actual joke itself.  (this seems weird but I'm pretty sure that's what he said more or less).

- He also said you can get some people to laugh by sheer physical movements and sounds. I agreed like yes of course people laugh at physical comedy etc. He says no, no really like that. Like if he tells a joke (again, possibly weak or he knows the audience will not like it) he can pump it up just by sort of 'walking it'. Like actually physically move with the sentences and then actually physically appear to lurch forward and at the punchline .. well literally 'punch' the line. like punch at the audience into the air. 

- Another 'trick' if you will was where a guy said, if he can see a really harsh crowd. He will deliberately unzip his fly or another version is he misbuttons his shirt. He says, almost every single time, even the deadest audience, this tricks at least one person to shout it out or engage. He even has preplanned things like he'll pretend not to catch what they said and say ""A fly? theres a fly on me"" or ""you want to press my buttons what?"".  

Mind you, the latter seems more like just actual physical comedy but I see what they mean. These are like 'tricks' that don't have anything to do with the actual written jokes or 'the act' or bits or whatever you call it.

Anyway, I found that totally fascinating! The problem is we all had to get going and I may not see them for a while. I need to know more! 

What tricks (well, techniques, physical setups etc) what else?",What are these standup 'Tricks' comedians use?

StandUpComedy,"I started going to open mics in my hometown in California and fell in love with doing it and decided it’s something I want to pursue. Recently I moved to LA and finally feel settled enough to start going to them out here. I still haven’t made very many friends here yet so I’ll be completely solo. I don’t mind, but the problem is that I’d like to record my first set out here. Back at home I always had a friend that would take a video on my phone for me. Obviously that’s not an option so I was thinking of paying a stranger to do it or something? I know some spots record the comics but not sure if I can rely on that. Is there some sort of etiquette to this? I need advice, I really want to get this next bit recorded (and my first in Los Angeles for sentimental reasons).

StandUpComedy,"Never really knew who she was but the I remember the Mrs watching the tv show Glaser had 5 or so years ago. She was recently brought back into our homes via a competition she was recently on (don't want to spoil anything), but the whole competition, I thought she was very annoying and unoriginal. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and I get an email from a local venue giving away free tickets to Nikki Glaser. I enter for s&amp;g since I figure the Mrs would enjoy the show. 

I end up winning the tickets, we find a sitter and attend the show. The opener, Anya something, sang a few songs but really only talked about how she has songs in movies and tv shows, that was the whole thing...???? It was weird. Then after on stage for only 17 minutes, Nikki comes in duet style with her mic turned up to 11 just destroying everyone's ears! Couldn't hold the note, no vibrato, all bad. The thing is, she wasnt trying to be funny, she was actually trying to sing.

Then the jokes started.........or should I say ""jokes""?

It was the same unoriginal 3 jokes that she stretches and re-tells to make last 90 minutes!!!! At the one hour mark of being bored out of my mind, the Mrs gives me ""the look"" and we bail so we can beat the traffic. 

Was it fine for free? I guess?

Am I an ass or do I not understand comedy? It wasn't like she was offending me or anything. It just felt like listening to a girl at a bar talk non-stop for an hour.

I was reading the comments on his 2012 special and seeing a bunch of very recent comments calling him unfunny and such. Which is frustrating because that is EXACTLY what I’ve been saying this whole time, but I’m surprised people are still saying that after he redeemed himself with his newest special.

StandUpComedy,"I've noticed this recent obsession of many people with ""punching up"" in humor, as if that's a pre-requisite for even validating your attempts at humor. I see a fundamental problem with that - it shifts the inherent focus of humor from its very core - being funny - to something different. What exactly? Well, if you insist that humor should only be directed at those in power, then you come across as seeking to use humor as a way of venting your frustration, or have a momentary feeling of taking back a bit of the power that the wealthy and powerful have. It's a nice feeling, sure, but it has nothing to do with something being *funny.*   


Recently, many people have adopted an ideological stance that the perceived unfortunate must be propped up at all costs, and never brought down - and the rich and powerful, never deserving of what they have, should be brought down. This conviction permeates many, many domains of daily life. But when it comes to humor - these people fail to notice that rules of morality should fly out the window. There is only one purpose that humor has - to make people laugh. The inability to understand that seemingly cruel, insensitive or wicked humor does not have to align with the person's actual views, and some people simply find that kind of humor funny - largely due to understanding that most of the time *you don't mean it.*   


Enjoying shock humor is not something to be judged in terms of morality. This simple truth is drowning in a sea of moral judgment by a puritanical majority, and it's for all intents and purposes, *contrary to the spirit of humor as a whole*. If at least part of you, on some level, can't laugh at say, people who stutter, or how people with cerebral palsy act - you are a humorless person. I can understand that sometimes laughing at something may feel bad or leave you conflicted (probably the source of all those ""I'm going to hell"" comments), but that just proves funniness and morality are simply at odds with each other some of the time - and we need to embrace that part of humor instead of trying to erase it for fear of making someone feel sad or put down.   


South Park's joke about Sarah Jessica Parker, calling her a ""transvestite donkey witch"", wasn't funny becasue it was directed at a highly wealthy and successful woman. It was funny because of the creative insult and choice of words - it would have been *equally as funny* if directed at a poor, destitute woman working 2 jobs to make ends meet and bogged down by crippling student debt. Who it is about is *simply not the point.* That's my point :D   


Humor is about being funny and making you laugh, not about fostering sensitivity to human misfortune and indignation at injustice. Not everything in life needs to be evaluated in terms of oppressors vs oppressed. Agree or not?","Punching down is funny. Nay, who you punch is not even relevant to the funniness."

StandUpComedy,"So on a whim, I decided to try stand up at an open mic last night and I had a lot of fun. I know I probably wasn't very funny, I didn't write anything, I just completely winged it. Thankfully, I'm not the nervous type, and I have no shame and don't care if I bomb. I mostly just ranted, and while I did get some laughs, I noticed my rants didn't really set up a punchline or a zinger, So I was thinking about going to another open mic tonight and building on what I started yesterday but adding like a punchline to the end of a rant. But besides that self critique, I really don't know anything about stand up, I do watch some stand up and my favorite comedian is Gary Gulman. So just curious to hear from some of you who are more experienced than I am... What are some things a beginner should know/think about when attempting stand up for the first couple times? Any advice?

I'll try to get a video tonight and post it to see what you guys think if thats something that is allowed on this subreddit",What are some things someone just getting into doing stand up should know?

Oh Dan moved away” and he learned it was just some random second husband not his real grandpa.

I started a YouTube channel to upload podcasts about tips for mental health and people struggling from depression/anxiety. I try to use motivational speaking with a mix of comedy thrown in to lighten the mood. 

I don’t do this for fame or money or any of that shit. I want to try to help people in the same shoes that I am in. 

Do you think this is something that people would possibly listen to? Do you guys think this is something that would be able to help people?

With everyone here being from the comedy world I figured this would be a good place to ask.

I’m not sure really where to post this so I figured I would try here and see if I can get some insight from anyone. 

If anyone here struggles with mental health, would this be something that could maybe help you? Try to relieve some stress from your everyday life while also trying to help people?

If this is against the rules please let me know so I can delete it but I’m just trying to get some outsider knowledge on this as I’m completely new to this.

4 months into living here, and I like the area, but the comedy scene is kinda... meh. 

Don't get me wrong, you can hit the mics 2-3x a night, there's clubs, Rogan's new joint is opening in a couple months, and you do see some industry rub shoulders with us lowly open mikers. You can find something to like in ATX, but the scene is already oversaturated with people from all over the country and most of the open mics suck. The ones that are good, like the mics that the clubs run, are heavily curated to the point that it's just the same people on every week unless if you show up 3-4 hours early to get on stand-by. Even Kill Tony is overrated. 

But I hear from some folks that Denver is a better spot. Smaller city and less run down, with a strong comedy presence, but one that isn't over saturated with Rogan/Hinchcliffe cultists, and of course, legal weed. I don't know, would it be worth it checking it out?","Austin, TX or Denver, CO?"

A joke does not have to approved by everyone’s feelings to be funny.

I don’t get what these people want by trying to draw a line in comedy.
Do they want to live in a world where absolutely no one is allowed to make fun of any other persons appearance, culture, likes, dislikes?

Where does that slippery slope lead?

Eventually you won’t be able to make a joke about an animal because people will be offended for them.
Eventually you won’t be able to tell a joke about an inanimate object because someone who used that object will be offended.

StandUpComedy,"Hey Sebastian, it only got “quiet” because you simply stopped talking. I get it… You obviously did that intentionally to start your bit, but there is no logic in the way you set it up. Are you implying that just because you said there was an “Asian man” the crowd should have immediately erupted in laughter? Did you really try to gaslight your viewers into thinking there’s something wrong with society if they don’t laugh simply because you said a person was “Asian” with no relevant context before or after? 

All this tells me about Sebastian Maniscalco is that he is apparently legit racist against Asians—not in the oversensitive “can’t-take-a-joke” sense, but in a legitimate “actually racist” sense. 

There really is no other logical way to explain that bit about one third into his latest special. It was basically a cringey lecture by Sebastian that people must be uptight if they don’t burst out laughing at the mere mention of an Asian man. 🤔

I know this will probably go down as an unpopular opinion, but this guy’s schtick is getting increasingly old and dried out. His earlier specials were pretty hilarious. Seems like he ran out of witty and snappy funny things to say/do and is now relying on the ever-tiresome “angry comedian because it’s society’s fault” routine. That may be partly true, but in this particular case, no Sebastian it’s because you’re just not that funny anymore. Your setups are lazy and in this particular case, cringey and nonsensical.",Sebastian Maniscalco thinks you should laugh just at the mere mention of an Asian man.
